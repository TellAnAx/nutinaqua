# APO-SUB-2: Investigating the origin of nutrients in closed freshwater aquaculture systems
It is assumed that the majority of nutrients enters an aquaculture system via the feed. However, when focussing on "downstream utilization" of nutrients, it must be considered that a fraction of the import flow of nutrients is being retained in the biomass before being available "for further use".



# TO DO

### Aquafeeds
- **does it make sense to include roots, tubers, and grains in the feedstuff overview?**
- **update table construction in Feeding as nutrient source**
- make sketch with fish and excretory paths of nutrients

### Alkalinity
- **alkalinity data**

### Nutrient budget
- **Permutations**
  - collect digestibility data (P: Sugiura2018)
  - simulate normally distributed digestibility
  - permutate on FEED + ADC
  - calculate all possible output scenarios
