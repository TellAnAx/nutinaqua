# APO-SUB-2: Investigating the origin of nutrients in closed freshwater aquaculture systems

It is assumed that the majority of nutrients enters an aquaculture
system via the feed. However, when focussing on “downstream utilization”
of nutrients, it must be considered that a fraction of the import flow
of nutrients is being retained in the biomass before being available
“for further use”.

# TO DO

### Introduction

- update intro

### Methodology

- add sentence regarding MLE
- improve explanation for alkalinity supps

# QUESTIONS

### Aquafeeds

- **does it make sense to include roots, tubers, and grains in the
  feedstuff overview?**

### Alkalinity

### Nutrient budget

- **Permutations**
  - is the approach understandable?
