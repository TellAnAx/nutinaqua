# APO-SUB-2: Investigating the origin of nutrients in closed freshwater aquaculture systems

It is assumed that the majority of nutrients enters an aquaculture
system via the feed. However, when focussing on “downstream utilization”
of nutrients, it must be considered that a fraction of the import flow
of nutrients is being retained in the biomass before being available
“for further use”.

# TO DO

### General

- **check whether Scopus AI finds a paper that is somehow similar to
  this one!**

### Aquafeeds

- **update table construction in Feeding as nutrient source**
- make sketch with fish and excretory paths of nutrients

### Alkalinity

- **alkalinity data**

### Nutrient budget

- **Permutations**
  - simulate normally distributed digestibility
  - conduct statistical test to check whether contribution of water is
    significantly greater than 0
  - extract data so that probability can be calculated for occurrences
    of xyz

# QUESTIONS

### Aquafeeds

- **does it make sense to include roots, tubers, and grains in the
  feedstuff overview?**

### Alkalinity

### Nutrient budget

- **Permutations**
  - is the approach understandable?
