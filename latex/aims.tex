The objective of this study is to assess the nutrient budget of aquaculture systems with regards to the contribution and variability of aquafeeds, alkalinity supplements, and the source water. Emphasis is given to plant nutrients as their successfull management is crucial for the functioning of integrated systems such as aquaponics. Expanding the body of knowledge with regards to this aspect is thus expected to contribute to improvements of these food production systems by further advancing means of nutrient management.
