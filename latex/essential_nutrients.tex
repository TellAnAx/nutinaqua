Fish and plants differ in their nutritional requirements, as shown in Table \ref{tab:essentials}.

Fish as well as plants require a set of nutrients that can be divided into macro- and micronutrients, according to their required quantities. Carbon and oxygen are required by both fish and plants in large quantities. Further essential macronutrients for both are calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Iron, copper, manganese, and zinc are essential micronutrients for both fish and plants. All of these elements are required for physiological functions such as the development and maintenance of the skeletal system, processes such as signal transmission, osmoregulation, as reactive centers of metalloenzymes (e.g., Haemoglobin, Chlorophyll), and others [@Lall2021; @Marschner2012]. Further nutrients that are only relevant for fish are chromium, fluoride, iodine, and sodium. Meanwhile, essential plant nutrients that are not essential for fish are are boron, silicone, and nickel [@Bittsanszky2016].
