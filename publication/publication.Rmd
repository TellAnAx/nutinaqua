abstract: |
  Integrated multitrophic aquaculture is  are seen as  Optimising substance inputs in a holistic way, into aquaculture systems and their variability is necessary for the efficient co-cultivation of "fed" aquaculture species together with nutrient extractors. However, the literature largely focusses on "fed" species. This study closer examines substance input routes and their contribution to the total substance inputs in closed and semi-open freshwater aquaculture systems. The results clearly show that nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and zinc enter via the feed in closed aquaculture systems with low water exchange rates. The route of entry of other nutrients in turn depends on the location of the system and the water source available there. At this stage, it seems reasonable to focus on nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and zinc in the development of a specific feed for IMTA. However, the formulation of a general all-purpose fish feed for integrated freshwater aquacultures seems unrealistic, as the geographical variations in water composition in Europe do not allow for a reproducible nutrient input regardless of location. Instead, individual solutions will continue to be necessary for each plant in the future. The use of potassium-based alkaline additives has proven to be extremely useful here. Despite the higher price, the supply of potassium can be ensured in a targeted manner. The outcomes of this study will contribute to the development of better nutrient management practices in integrated freshwater aquaculture and provide a new insight into substance flows in such systems.

# Introduction
The production of food inevitably contributes to changes in our environment, such as global warming, pollution, and biodiversity loss [@Foley2005]. Nevertheless, the aquaculture industry will have to grow further in order to cover the predicted increase in demand [@FAO2022]. Here, it would be particularly important for Europe to promote its aquaculture industry and thus contribute to the reduction of food miles, considering that 2.5 times more seafood is currently being imported than exported [@EU2024]. At the same time, this growth must be in line with current policies such as the EU Green Deal and associated policy plans, meaning that aquaculture should cause net-zero emissions and its wastes should be returned into the material cycle [@EU2019; @EU2020; @EU2020a]. Against this background and the restrictive handling of water usage rights in the EU, \gls{ras} is the most promising option for (freshwater) aquaculture. It allows the highest level of control over all system inputs and outputs. Downstream utilisation can then take place in form of biorefinery processes such as the production of biogas [@Choudhury2022; @Lobanov2023], volatile fatty acids [@Suhr2015], or usage as fertiliser through direct field application [@Yogev2020] or sludge digestate as plant nutrient solution [@Monsees2017; @Delaide2017; @Goddek2018; @Lobanov2023]. Another approach is the co-cultivation of two or multiple species of different trophic levels in the same system, also known as \gls{imta}. The extractive species absorbs dissolved or suspended residues *in situ* that are not fully utilised by the primary, "fed" species. The extractive species can then be commercialised as additional harvest (e.g., aquaponics, @Rakocy2006). \gls{imta} therefore has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of aquaculture while increasing its output [@Klinger2012]. However, industrial adoption of \gls{imta} (including aquaponics) in Europe is low due to reasons such as high initial investment costs, and overall complexity [@Turnsek2020; @Hughes2016].

A simple way to reduce complexity for the single entity is to split the system into parts where each entity focusses on one core task. These evolved company structures are also known as industrial ecosystems or industrial symbiosis. Here, two or more companies join forces and use residual materials from each other's production processes. The most well-known example is located in Kalundborg, Denmark [@Ehrenfeld1997; @Jacobsen2008]. Examples in the field of aquaculture are the companies Gr{\o}nt Fra Laks and Vertical Agri in Norway, even though at much smaller scale. However, it is obvious that such systems can only function efficiently if the raw material supply is continuous and can be planned. It is therefore worth considering to alter the nutrient input in such a way that the residues are available in quantities and ratios that allow their downstream valorisation (e.g., biorefinery, hydroponics) with the highest possible efficiency while not jeopardising the main business (aquaculture). 

An obvious approach to achieve this goal in aquaculture is to formulate a feed which, after a proportion of the feed was retained by the fish (or other fed species), provides the optimal conditions for extractive species or sludge utilisation. Aquafeeds are considered the most important source of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus [@Yang2021; @Sugiura2018] into aquaculture systems. This approach was therefore taken up by scholars in the field of aquaponics (the combination of tank-based aquaculture and hydroponics, @Baganz2021), who, by using alternative raw materials, have achieved an increase in the excretion of certain nutrients [@Shaw2022; @Shaw2022a; @Gebauer2023; @Shaw2024]. Interestingly, the claim that feed is the most important source of nutrients in aquaculture systems has never been substantiated to the best of the authors' knowledge. Although a few studies have looked at the contribution of different nutrient sources to the total input [@Delaide2017; @Strauch2018], the results are sometimes contradictory  and cannot be considered representative, given the variability of the chemical composition of water. 

Knowing the sources of nutrients, their contribution to the total input and their geographical variability is necessary to find out which substances can actually be effectively controlled in terms of their quantity in the system by targeted input via the feed. For example, the greater the proportion of water in the total input, the greater the increase in the content of the same substance in the feed must be in order to produce a noticeable effect. If the aim is to have a certain amount of one substance or two or more substances present in the system in a certain ratio, this can only be guaranteed if the variability of the input of the same substances from other sources is low. Otherwise, it could be the case that the desired quantity or ratio is only achieved for a small proportion of users (e.g. in a certain geographical region) of the feed. In other places, however, an undersupply of the nutrient in question would still be observed, for example because the water is poorer in the substance. Toxicity could also potentially occur if an unexpected amount of the substance enters the system via other nutrient sources.

The aim of this study is to characterise the nutrient input into closed freshwater aquaculture systems in Europe. To this end, the most important input routes (feed, water and buffers) are first analysed with regard to their average nutrient loads and variability. The various input routes are then compared with each other in a probabilistic manner and assessed in terms of their importance as input route for particular nutrients that are essential for animals and plants.
The results of this study are an important building block for the development of feeds with which aquaculture can be better integrated into a circular economy. Knowledge about nutrient inputs into aquaculture systems will also be helpful for other fields targeting at valorising aquaculture residues or reducing emissions from aquaculture systems.

# Methodology

## Data acquisition

### Aquafeeds
Nutrient inclusion rates of commercial feeds (n = `r results$n_feeds_commercial`) for Common carp (\emph{Cyprinus carpio}), Pike-perch (\emph{Sander lucioperca}), Nile tilapia (\emph{Oreochromis niloticus}), African catfish (\emph{Clarias gariepinus}), and Rainbow trout (\emph{Oncorhynchus mykiss}) were compiled from feed manufacturer datasheets and `r results$n_feeds_commercial_literature` data records were collected from literature (studies using commercial feeds). The mentioned species were chosen due to their cumulated share of $\approx \SI{23}{\p}$ of world freshwater fish production [@FAO2022]. In addition, `r results$n_feeds_experimental` records about experimental feeds were collected from literature. To find the mentioned literature studies, Scopus was used with the search terms AQUACULTURE, FEED, AQUAPONIC*, and IMTA in different combinations. Resulting studies were screened for information regarding the nutrient composition of utilised feeds.


### Water
Tap water analysis reports from locations all over Europe were collected from local authorities and water utilities in the corresponding municipalities. The collected `r results$n_wateranalysis` water analysis reports originated from a total of `r results$n_wateranalysis_countries` countries. It is common to report the value of the instrument detection limit instead of the measured value if the analyte concentration found was below the sensitivity of the measurement instrument [@ISO11843]. This practice is known as data censoring. Retaining these data points in the dataset would have led to an overestimation of plant nutrient concentrations within the tap water. Therefore, mean average nutrient concentrations in tap water were estimated by \gls{mle}, using the *cenmle()* function from the R package NADA [@Helsel2011]. 
In addition, `r results$n_observations_water_rain` rain water analyses were collected from literature. The spatial distribution of the data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:map_water}.

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{../output/plots/map.png}
  \caption{Geographical distribution of water analysis reports included in the source water dataset. Green: analysis of municipal tap water; Red: rainwater analysis.}
  \label{fig:map_water}
\end{figure}
```


### Alkalinity supplements
The input of alkalinity supplements was estimated based on @Timmons2010, with an amount of \SI{250}{\g} sodium bicarbonate (\ce{NaHCO3}) being recommended per \si{\kg} input of feed with a \gls{cp} content of \SI{35}{\p}. The \gls{cp} content can be converted to $\frac{\SI{350}{\gkg}}{6.25 \cdot M_{\ce{N}}} = \SI{4}{\mol\per\kg}$ of feed. Given the molar mass of \ce{NaHCO3} of $M(\ce{NaHCO3}) = \SI{84.01}{\gmol}$, considering that $n(\ce{HCO3-}) = n(\ce{NaHCO3})$ results in $n = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{\SI{250}{\g}}{\SI{84.01}{\gmol}} = \SI{2.975}{\mol}$ of \ce{HCO3-} and thus a molar input of $\frac{\SI{2.975}{\mol}}{\SI{4}{\mol\per\kg}} \approx \SI{0.75}{\mol\per\mol}$ of a single charged cation such as \ce{Na+} or \ce{K+}. This number has to be divided by 2 for double charged cations such as \ce{Ca^2+} and \ce{Mg^2+}.


## Contribution analysis
\label{sec:method_contribution}
The contribution analysis followed the assumption that the water quality at the chosen location is likely to be subject to comparatively small fluctuations, while the system operator can theoretically choose from any feed available on the market. Eventually, a range of fish species which differ in the retention of the nutrients supplied could be grown. This results in $n = n_{\text{water}} \cdot n_{\text{feed}} \cdot n_{\text{retention}}$ combinations of water, aquafeeds, and the nutrient retention, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:scheme_combinations}. Furthermore, different amounts of makeup water could be used, depending on the technology level of the system. 

```{=tex}
%\begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics{../latex/permutations.png}
%  \caption{Schematic depiction of the generation of combinations for the %contribution analysis.}
%\end{figure}
```

The dataset for the combination analysis was created by combining water and aquafeed composition metadata that was gathered as described above. Both commercial and experimental feed data was used. Only those nutrients that were present in both water and feed datasets were used. 

The feed input was standardised to $m_{f} = \SI{1}{\kg}$ and three make-up water levels ($V_{w} =  \SI{10}{\L\per\kg}$, \SI{100}{\L\per\kg}, and \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} of feed input) were used. This was assumed as representative for a wide range of fish species [@Dalsgaard2013; @Kloas2015; @Mota2015]. To illustrate the makeup water levels, at a stocking density of $d = \SI{50}{\kg\per\cubicm}$ and a feeding rate of $r_{f} = \SI{2}{\p}$, the resulting system volume would equal to $\frac{m_{f}}{r_{f} \cdot d} \cdot \SI{1000}{\L\per\cubicm} = \SI{1000}{\L}$ and the daily water exchange rates would correspond to \SI{1}{\p}, \SI{10}{\p}, and \SI{100}{\p}, respectively. 

The absolute contributions of water ($a_{w}$) and feed ($a_{f}$) were calculated by multiplying the inputs of feed ($m_{f}$) and water ($V_{w}$) with the corresponding inclusion of each nutrient ($x$) in water ($c_{x}$) and in feed ($\gamma_{x}$). The latter was then multiplied with the possible excretion rates ($r_{e}$), which were computed from nutrient retention rates ($r_{r}$) as $r_{e} = 1 - r_{r}$. Three nutrient retention rates were used, with the mean based on literature data [@Sugiura2018; @Roy2022] and a deviation of $\pm\SI{5}{\p}$ to account for intra- and inter-species variability. Eventually, the absolute contribution of water or feed was converted to its percentage contribution to the total as $p_{(w \lor f)} = \frac{a_{(w \lor f)}}{a_{f} + a_{w}} \cdot \SI{100}{\p}$.


## Statistics and software
All calculations and analyses were done using R (v.4.3.2).
Statistical analyses were conducted if $n>5$. Pairwise comparisons of means were conducted with t-tests after testing for normality and variance homogeneity using Bartletts test and the Levene test, respectively. 










# Essential nutrients for fish and plants

```{=tex}
\label{sec:essential_nutrients}
```

Fishes as well as plants require a set of elements for the functioning of their metabolism. However, they differ in the mode of uptake, the required elements and their quantities. As the focus of aquaculture is on the fish, feed contains the nutrients that cannot be absorbed in sufficient quantities for optimum growth elsewhere. The content of some of these nutrients, such as crude protein, is clearly defined in the respective feed formulations. Others are added to the feed in standardised mixtures. However, the water is also subject to certain regulations, provided the water source is tap water.However,the water is also subject to certain regulations, provided the water source is tap water. Table \ref{tab:essentials} provides an overview of the essential elements for both fish and plants, and constraints for feed formulation and their concentrations in tap water.

```

Both fishes and plants require carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur as essential building bricks of the cells and for cellular respiration. Further essential macronutrients for both are phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. All organisms require phosphorus as building block for \gls{dna} and \gls{rna} and for energy storage in \gls{atp}. It is also the major constituent of phospholipids that form cell membranes. In fish, phosphorus is, in combination with calcium, required for the development and maintenance of the skeletal system [@Lall2021]. Plants also require calcium for their growth, as biochemical processes such as cell elongation and division are affected by calcium [@Mengel2001].
Magnesium contributes to many biological processes in all organisms, from protein synthesis, over cell replication to the energy metabolism. In fish, it also plays a key role in signal transmission via the nervous system, among others [@Lall2021]. Magnesium is the central atom of chlorophyll in plants and is thus crucial for the functioning of photosynthesis [@Mengel2001].

Essential micronutrients required by both fish and plants are iron, copper, manganese, and zinc. 
Iron and copper are important constituents of many metalloproteins and metalloenzymes, such as heme proteins, cytochromes, among others [@Marschner2012; @Lall2021]. After iron, zinc is the second most abundant micronutrient in living organisms. Even though it is a constituent of metalloenzymes, it does not take part in redox reactions. Instead, it stabilises the enzyme structure [@Lall2021; @Marschner2012]. Manganese is an important co-factor for the activation of enzymes. It is also part of some metalloenzymes [@Marschner2012]. In vertebrates, it is involved in bone mineralisation [@Lall2021]. 

A trace element with proven relevance for fish but without physiological function in plants is iodine. Fish require iodine as constituent of the thyroid hormones that play a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and functioning [@Lall2021].

Plant nutrients that are not essential for fish comprise boron, nickel, molybdenum, and chlorine [@Marschner2012]. Boron has been suggested to have several roles in metabolism, formation of cell wall structure, and substance transport. However, even though required in the largest amounts of all plant micronutrients, the physiological role of boron has not been fully understood [@Marschner2012]. Nickel is another micromineral that was found to be essential, while its functions are not yet fully explored. As transition metal, it is again a constituent of metalloproteins and -enzymes [@Marschner2012]. Molybdenum is mostly involved in the nitrogen metabolism, either as constituent or co-factor of metalloenzymes [@Marschner2012]. Chlorine is an indispensable element for the maintenance of the ion balance and the stabilisation of the membrane potential. Even though considered a micronutrient due to it's low requirement, it is present in amounts that are comparable with macronutrients [@Marschner2012].





# Nutrient inputs into semi-open and closed intensive aquaculture systems
Nutrients can enter closed aquaculture systems via feed input, water exchange, the addition of chemicals, and gas exchange. However, for the nutrients mentioned in the previous section, with the exception of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, gas exchange is negligible as a route of entry.


## Aquafeeds
\label{sec:feed}
In order to achieve optimum growth of the cultivated species, a variety of aquafeeds has been developed, which is constantly increasing. The amount of feed depends on the biomass of the animals in the aquaculture facility. Typically, between one and two per cent of the total biomass is added daily in the form of feed.


### Composition of commercial diets and changes over the years
The raw material composition of aquafeeds has changed substantially over time. For instance, the amount of fish meal has been reduced in favor of mostly plant-based ingredients [@MOWI2023]. It could thus be assumed that the inclusion rates of those nutrients that are not kept at constant levels during feed formulation changed as well. However, the most recent general overview study of mineral inclusion rates in aquafeeds dates back more than 40 years [@Tacon1983]. Figure \ref{fig:feedcomp} provides an overview of nutrient inclusion rates compiled from literature studies and feed manufacturer datasheets.

```{r feedcomp, include=FALSE, fig.cap="Inclusion rates of some nutrients essential for fish or plants in different types of aquafeeds.

Nitrogen and phosphorus are subject of continuous research in the field of fish nutrition because nitrogen in form of \gls{cp} is an important cost factor in feed production. Phosphorus, meanwhile, is problematic because it is present in poorly digestible form in some mostly plant-based raw materials. It is therefore excreted in comparatively large quantities and can, in dependence on the production system, lead to water eutrophication and algae blooms [@Sugiura2018].
As a consequence, nitrogen inclusion rates have decreased from values ranging around \SI{96}{\gkg} (\SI{60}{\p} \gls{cp}) in the early days of aquafeed production to approximately \SI{72}{\gkg} (\SI{45}{\p} \gls{cp}) for salmonid fish [@MOWI2023]. An average of \SI{63.9}{\gkg} (\SI{41.5}{\p} \gls{cp}; \gls{cv} = \SI{18.5}{\p}) is found in feeds for freshwater species such as carp, tilapia, catfish, and percids (n = 74). The range covered was \SIrange{40}{89.6}{\gkg} (\SIrange{250}{560}{\gkg} \gls{cp}). The decrease in nitrogen can be ascribed to discoveries such as the protein sparing effect, for instance in rainbow trout, carp, and tilapia [@Takeuchi1978; @Beamish1986; @Shiau1993] and improvements in the digestibility of aquafeeds. 

In the case of phosphorus, average inclusion rates decreased by about `r round((1-16.252/11.662)*100)`\si{\p}, from \SI{16}{\gkg} to \SI{12}{\gkg} (n = 68). The reduction was achieved by a two-step approach, combining the reduction of dietary phosphorus with efforts to increase its bioavailability in aquafeeds [@Sugiura2018]. Phosphorus addition to feeds is treated restrictively, which is evident from the low variability (\gls{cv} = \SI{21}{\p}).

Information about inclusion rates of other nutrients in commercial standard feeds was found in scientific studies (n = 5). The calcium content of aquafeeds in the collected data (n = 5) is on average `r round((1-22.676/17.56)*100)`\si{\p} lower in comparison with past values. This might be due to the close nutritional relation of calcium with phosphorus and the resulting necessity to maintain an optimum calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the feeds [@Hossain2014]. As a result, the variability of the calcium inclusion is equal to that of phosphorus (\gls{cv} = \SI{21}{\p}).
The magnesium and iron content of aquafeeds, meanwhile, might not have changed. The average magnesium content is \SI{2.2}{\gkg} (n = 3) in comparison with \SI{2.1}{\gkg} in past feeds. On average, \SI{200}{\mgkg} iron is found in aquafeeds (n = 4), even though highly variable (\gls{cv} = \SI{113}{\p}, range \SIrange{40}{544}{\mgkg}). Comparably high variability in iron was already noticed in the past [@Tacon1983].

Nowadays, aquafeeds may contain more copper, zinc, and potassium. The average copper inclusion rate increased by `r round((1-15/20)*100)`\si{\p} (n = 4), with a variability comparable with iron (\gls{cv} = \SI{93}{\p}). In the case of zinc, average inclusion rates are `r round((1-90/207)*100)`\si{\p} higher (n = 4), while `r round((1-9.5/11.2)*100)`\si{\p} more potassium is present in modern commercial aquafeeds (n = 2). The variability is comparable with nitrogen and phosphorus (zinc: \gls{cv} = \SI{61}{\p}; potassium: \gls{cv} = \SI{20}{\p}).

The authors highlight the lack of mineral composition data in the field of aquaculture nutrition, making a statistically sound comparison between past and present values impossible.


### Speciality feeds
The importance of aquafeeds as nutrient input is reflected by the development of several specialty feeds. For instance, low-pollution feeds have thus been developed that cause reduced nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from pond and cage aquaculture [@Pigott2003; @MilianSorribes2021]. \gls{ras} pose similar problems for the aquaculture industry due to high initial and operation costs for water purification systems. Reducing the need for water treatment through the development of aquafeeds with highly bioavailable nutrients or  therefore reduces costs on the long run. Feeds for \gls{imta}, in contrast, are supposed to increase the excretion of specific nutrients. As of now, at least three commercial aquaponics feeds are commercially available. However, according to the datasheets, two out of three feeds do not differ from standard feeds in their phosphorus content. Information with regards to potassium and calcium inclusion rates were reported only for one feed. Here, their inclusion rates were `r (1-20/11)*100`\si{\p} higher and `r (1-15/18)*100`\si{\p} lower than in standard feeds, respectively.


### Experimental feeds
In the recent past, several experiments were conducted to closer examine the extent to which substance excretion patterns by fish are affected by alterations in the raw material composition of aquafeeds [@Gebauer2023; @Shaw2022; @Shaw2022a]. The overall nutrient composition of the experimental diets is comparable with commercially available standard aquafeeds, with no significant differences in average nutrient inclusion levels. Potassium (t-test: p = 0.3), phosphorus (t-test: p = 0.1), calcium (t-test: p = 0.4), and magnesium (t-test: p = 0.7) had average inclusion rates of \SI{9(2.8)}{\gkg}, \SI{14(4.9)}{\gkg}, \SI{15(8.4)}{\gkg}, and \SI{2(0.7)}{\gkg}, respectively.
Also, no differences were found for iron (t-test: p = 0.4), copper (t-test: p = 0.7), and zinc (t-test: p = 0.2). The average inclusion rates were \SI{348(29)}{\mgkg}, \SI{16(2.9)}{\mgkg}, and \SI{93(35.8)}{\mgkg}, respectively.


### Sources of variability
Besides the obviously different nutritional requirements of different fish species, variability in the composition of feed is caused by the natural variability in the composition of feed raw materials. In the past, feed was formulated with a fixed nutrient composition. As fish meal and fish oil made up a large proportion of the feed and the range of other raw materials was small compared to today, it can be assumed that the feed composition and growth performance remained relatively constant.
Nowadays, however, an increasing proportion of fish meal and oil is being replaced by plant-based raw materials for reasons of cost reduction and sustainability. Although the proportion of macronutrients in the feed formulation is kept constant, fish meal replacement has an impact on the remaining, non-fixed nutrients. Figure \ref{fig:feedstuffs} gives an overview of the variability of several substances in different raw materials relevant for aquafeed production (data adapted from @IAFFD2021). For example, the proportion of potassium and zinc in non-marine raw materials is up to ten times lower and the proportion of phosphorus in some plant-based raw materials is up to a hundred times lower than in fish meal. 

The dynamic and more varied composition of the raw materials also has an effect on the digestibility of the feed. Two feeds with an identical proximate composition but different raw material compositions can differ significantly in terms of nutrient digestibility and therefore the growth performance of the fish [@Glencross2020]. For this reason, feeds are no longer formulated on the basis of proximate composition, but on the basis of digestibility. This is the case for current feed formulation approaches such as the Aller Aqua Power2 and PowerRAS concept [@AllerAqua2017; @AllerAqua2019], the Alltech Coppens Net Energy concept [@AlltechCoppens2019], or the Biomar P 3.0 concept [@Biomar2019]. Focusing the feed formulation more closely on the target species thus reduces the predictability of the emissions of non-constrained substances. Considering that the proportion of marine feed components needs to be further reduced in order to achieve a sustainable growth of the aquaculture industry [@Hua2019], a further increasing proportion of alternative raw materials and, along with this, increased variability in other substances can be expected.

### From gross to net feed input
When discussing aquafeeds as nutrient input route into \gls{imta}, it has to be considered that the provided gross feed input does not correspond to the available nutrients for the co-cultivated organisms (see Figure \ref{fig:metabolism}). It must be considered that a fraction of nutrients is retained by the primary species.

Finfish species cultivated in aquaculture retain about \SI{19}{\p} of the nitrogen [@Fry2018] and \SI{40}{\p} of the phosphorus [@Sugiura2018] that is provided via aquafeeds. Due to the lack of data for other minerals, a conceptual study approximated their retention efficiency from the retention efficiency of ash as sum parameter [@Roy2022].















## Water as nutrient source
The source water of closed and semi-open aquaculture systems can originate from wells, the municipal tap, or surface water such as brooks or rivers [@Timmons2010; @Lawson1994]. In addition, rainwater might cover a share of the water demand in some locations (see e.g., @GallegoAlarcon2019). However, well or tap water is usually preferable as it is usually free of undesired pollutants and pathogens [@Lawson1994]. In the following, the focus is therefore on tap and rain water. 

The amount of water added daily is proportional to the stocking density, the daily feed input, and how efficiently the water can be treated in the system. Usually between 10 and \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} of feed are exchanged [@Dalsgaard2013].

Figure \ref{fig:waters} provides a general overview of the chemical composition of terrestrial waters. Data collected in the scope of the present study is shown in Table \ref{tab:watercomp}. The direct comparison between tap and rain water clearly shows that tap water is significantly richer in ions than rain water. The concentrations of ions found in rain water are in line with what was described as common for continental rain [@Wetzel2011].

```

Approximately \SI{35}{\p} of the tap water worldwide originates from groundwater sources [@Doell2012]. The composition of tap water is generally comparable to that of groundwater and usually only deviates from it if iron or manganese has to be removed from the raw water before it is fed into the drinking water system. However, it can be argued that large quantities of iron and manganese are also undesirable in the raw water of aquaculture facilities, as they precipitate after oxygenation of the water and can cause damage to pumps and other equipment. Groundwater quality is largely dependent on geochemical processes such as weathering of rock, ion exchange reactions and the build-up of biomass [@Stumm1996], which is also causing spatial variation in the water composition. Temporal fluctuations can be caused by weather events such as heavy rainfall, snowmelt, flooding, or anthropogenic activity, such as agriculture. However, depending on the properties of the soil and the percolation rate of the water, these effects can occur with a time lag.

The variability described above is only reflected to a limited extent in the composition of drinking water in the European Union, as this is regulated by the EU Drinking Water Directive [@EU2020]. A series of limit values (see Table \ref{tab:watercomp}) defines maximum values that should not be exceeded. The limit values for nitrate, nitrite, boron, copper and nickel (specified in Annex I, Part B) are related to potential health hazards. In addition, technical indicator parameters (defined in Annex I, Part C) regulate the pH, conductivity, ammonium, iron, manganese, sulfur (as sulphate), sodium and chloride content of the water to ensure the longevity of the drinking water system.

Compared to groundwater, rain water is poor in ions, as these do not pass into the gas phase during the evaporation of water. However, salt particles in the air can act as nuclei for raindrop formation and eventually dissolve in the water. In close proximity to the sea, sea spray is an important source of those particles. However, a significant proportion also originates from anthropogenic air pollution [@Wetzel2011].

## Alkalinity supplements as nutrient sources
The term alkalinity supplements summarises several alkaline substances that are used to maintain a stable pH in the water of closed and semi-open aquaculture systems. Fishes excrete ammonia as a metabolic end product, which then forms ammonium after reaction with water. Ammonium is then converted to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria in the biofilter. The conversion of ammonium to nitrate follows the overall simplified reaction depicted in Equation \ref{eq:nitrification} [@Timmons2010].

\begin{align}
  \ce{NH4+} + 2\ce{O2} + \ce{H2O} -> \ce{NO3-} + 2{H3O+}
  \label{eq:nitrification}
\end{align}

Per mole of converted ammonium, two moles of hydronium ions are released. This results in a steady drop of the pH towards regions in which the metabolic activity of the nitrifiers is inhibited [@Ward2011]. As countermeasure, a range of alkalinity supplements is used (see Table \ref{tab:alkalinity}). While sodium bicarbonate (\ce{NaHCO3}) is often used in \gls{ras}, liming with calcium carbonate (\ce{CaCO3}) is common practice in pond aquaculture [@Boyd2016].

```{=tex}
\input{../latex/table_alkalinitysuppl.tex}
```

It can be derived from equation \ref{eq:nitrification} that the amount of hydronium ions to be neutralised is proportional to the amount of nitrogen input from the feed. As a rule of thumb, \SI{4.7}{\g} of alkalinity as \ce{CaCO3} needs to be provided per \si{\g} of \gls{tan}. 
Alkalinity supplements play a special role with regard to nutrient input, as they contribute only one nutrient to the system in addition to their function as alkalinity suppliers. The proportion of this nutrient is therefore very high compared to the contribution of the feed or water. The variability is negligible, as the added substances are of comparably high purity [@Boyd2016].








# Drawing the big picture
The previous sections assessed which quantities of substances of interest for \gls{imta} can be expected in the most important inputs of an aquaculture facility and how variable they are. However, the proportions of nutrients in the individual material flows do not yet allow any statement to be made about their relevance for the overall nutrient budget of the aquaculture systems under consideration. For this reason, the data collected is compared regarding its empirical probability.


## Contribution of water and feed to total nutrient mass flows
The outcomes of the contribution analysis are shown in Figure \ref{fig:combinations}. Note that the diagrams show the respective empirical probabilities with which the percentage share of water in the total nutrient input of a nutrient lies within a given interval. Large differences in the share of the nutrient input and also in the variability of the expected share can be seen. An obvious finding is that the proportion of nutrients supplied by the water increases with increasing amounts of supplementary water. 

Overall, the proportion of phosphorus entering the system via tap water is negligible, which corroborates literature [@Sugiura2018]. Not more than \SI{5}{\p} of the total phosphorus input can be expected to enter the system via tap water under the examined conditions. At makeup (tap) water levels of \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} of feed, on the other hand, which are described as representative for salmonids and sturgeons [@Dalsgaard2013], more than \SI{80}{\p} of the inputs of potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, zinc, and copper can originate from the water and values above \SI{50}{\p} can be expected in \SIrange{40}{80}{\p} of all cases. Under such conditions, the contribution to the nitrogen input can be expected to range between \SIrange{40}{60}{\p}. 

At lower makeup water supplies ($\approx \SI{100}{\L\per\kg}$ of feed), the possible contribution of the water to the total input of calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, and copper can exceed \SI{80}{\p}, and the probability that tap water contributes more than \SI{50}{\p} of the input was found to be between \SIrange{40}{60}{\p} (\SI{20}{\p} for sulfur). Contributions to the zinc input between \SIrange{18}{40}{\p} have a probability of about \SI{40}{\p}, while potassium has \SIrange{15}{30}{\p} input share with \SI{40}{\p} probability. In the case of nitrogen, a share of \SIrange{6}{15}{\p} to the total input can be expected for tap water in all cases.

Makeup water levels as low as \SI{10}{\L\per\kg} of feed might be bearable for species such as African catfish. Here, tap water can still contribute between \SIrange{29}{50}{\p} of calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, and copper with a probability of \SI{20}{\p}. On the other hand, the contribution might be below \SI{5}{\p} with a probability of \SI{60}{\p} for sulfur, iron, and copper (\SI{40}{\p} for calcium, \SI{20}{\p} for magnesium). The contribution to the nitrogen, potassium, and zinc input is unlikely to exceed \SI{6}{\p}.

As nutrient concentrations are generally lower in rain water, it is obvious that the proportion of nutrients originating from tap water is higher than that of rain water. However, the results show that rainwater can certainly be responsible for comparatively large amounts of phosphorus input in some cases. Although the input share can be expected to be below \SI{1.5}{\p} with a probability of \SI{60}{\p}, it might contribute between \SIrange{10}{60}{\p} of the total input in \SI{20}{\p} of the scenarios (\SIrange{100}{1000}{\L} makeup water per \si{\kg} of feed). These unexpectedly high values could be a result of air pollution at rainwater sampling sites. A high temporal variability of the phosphorus concentration in rainwater was described in other studies [@Migon1999].

An important aspect in the evaluation of the data is to identify the source of variability. Figure \ref{fig:variability} illustrates that the coefficients of variance for the respective nutrients are greater in the water than in the feed in almost all cases. Except for iron, copper, and zinc in scenarios were rainwater is the sole water source, the variability found in the data was at least \SI{60}{\p} greater for the water than for the feed. The most pronounced differences between variabilities of feed and water were found for phophorus, potassium, magnesium, and copper in case of tap water and nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in case of rain water. As described in \ref{sec:feed}, the low variance of nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium in the feed is likely due to set constraints during feed formulation.

## The role of alkalinity supplements in nutrient mass flows
Alkalinity supplements play a special role with regard to nutrient input, as they consist of only one cation in addition to the carbonate, bicarbonate or hydroxide anion. In addition, alkalinity supplements can be freely selected by the system operator. There is therefore no permanent influence on the nutrient budget. However, it can be seen from Table \ref{tab:alkalinitycont} that the substance used to compensate for the loss of alkalinity caused by feeding and nitrification has a greater effect on the total nutrient input than the feed and water combined in almost all cases.

# Implications for nutrient management
The most important criterion for assessing the usefulness of a product for solving a problem is the reproducibility of the positive results obtained. In \gls{imta}, a conceivable criterion could be the constant amount of nutrients available for the co-cultivated organisms, regardless of the production location. However, this goal can only be achieved if one nutrient input clearly dominates the others regarding its contribution. 


## Feeds
The production of a special feed for integrated aquaculture harbours potential for increasing the efficiency of these systems. This study shows that in European freshwater aquaculture systems using less than \SI{100}{\L} makeup water per \si{\kg} of feed, feed dominates the input of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and zinc. In systems with lower water exchange rates or rainwater as sole water source, feed also dominates the input of all other nutrients investigated. However, this statement is not tenable at higher water exchange rates. It is also questionable whether the water requirements of an aquaculture system can be covered by rainwater. The geographical variability that is to be expected due to the different water compositions of groundwater and thus also tap water makes the usefulness of a "universally valid" feed formulation that leads to reproducible results everywhere appear doubtful, if nutrients other than nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc are targeted.

In addition to possibly non-reproducible results, increasing certain amounts of nutrients in the feed could have negative effects on the well-being of the fish. Increased dietary levels phosphorus, calcium and magnesium have been reported to cause nephrocalcinosis in a variety of freshwater fishes [@Takvam2023].

Dietborne toxicity of copper and zinc has not been demonstrated in fishes [@Clearwater2002]. The supply of those nutrients via the feed could thus be considered safe. However, as copper was found to be variable both in water and feeds, attempts to increase its inclusion rate in feeds might result in toxicity, either for the fed livestock or for secondary organisms.

With regards to feed formulation approaches, it might be more reasonable to target a fixed raw material composition for \gls{imta} feeds. This would reduce temporal fluctuations in the nutrient composition by ensuring that the variability depends on the natural variability of raw materials alone and not, in addition, on varying inclusion rates through the choice of raw materials. 


## Alkalinity supplements
This study demonstrates that potassium, calcium and magnesium salts are generally suitable for controlling the entry of the respective substances into the system. Considering the large effect size of using such salts, it might be cost-efficient to supply potassium via alkalinity supplements instead of the feed. The disadvantage of such substances, on the other hand, could be induced phosphate precipitation, which in turn would reduce the phosphate content in the system.


# Conclusion
This study shows that nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc enter closed aquaculture systems with low water exchange rates via the feed, while the input route of other nutrients is site-specific. At this stage, a special feed for \gls{imta} will have to be limited to nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and zinc. Meanwhile, the formulation of a general all-purpose fish feed for integrated freshwater aquacultures seems unrealistic, as the spatial fluctuations in the water composition over Europe do not allow a reproducible nutrient input. Instead, individual solutions will continue to be necessary. The use of potassium-based alkalinity supplements has proven to be extremely useful here. Despite the higher price, the supply of potassium can be guaranteed in a targeted manner.
