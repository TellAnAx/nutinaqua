# Introduction
The production of food inevitably contributes to drastic changes in our environment, such as global warming, pollution, and biodiversity loss [@Foley2005]. For this reason, the Farm-to-Fork strategy [@EU2020] was developed in Europe as part of the EU Green Deal [@EU2019]. One of its core aspects is the transition of food production towards a neutral or even positive environmental footprint. This also includes shortening supply chains in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions caused by food miles travelled. As Europe currently imports about 2.5 times more fish than it exports [@EU2024], this would mean that the European aquaculture industry will have to grow in the future to meet the demand for fish. However, this growth must be sustainable, as aquaculture is already making a noticeable contribution to environmental pollution as a result of its rapid growth over the past decades [@Beusen2016; @FAO2022].

Aquaculture is a biological system. For this reason, it is unavoidable that a certain proportion of the nutrients fed into the system are not fully utilised and accumulate as dissolved or solid residues. However, in the spirit of the Circular Economy Action Plan [@EU2020a], which was also presented as part of the EU Green Deal and aims to recycle waste instead of disposing of it, some of these residual materials can be reutilised. One possibility, for example, is the co-cultivation of two species of different trophic levels in the same system, also known as \gls{imta}. The extractive species absorbs dissolved or suspended residues *in situ* that are not fully utilised by the primary, "fed" species. The extractive species then either represents a further source of food for the primary species (nutritious pond concept, @Joffre2019; biofloc, @Avnimelech2015) or can be commercialised as an additional harvest (fish-rice co-culture, @Halwart2004; aquaponics, @Rakocy2006). \gls{imta} therefore has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of aquaculture while increasing its output [@Hughes2016; @Klinger2012]. 

Instead of, or in addition to, the dissolved and suspended substances, the solids that are deposited, for instance below cages, in ponds or raceway systems, or removed by mechanical filtration in \gls{ras} can also be utilised. Several studies investigated the suitability of these sludges for biorefinery processes such as the production of biogas [@Choudhury2022; @Lobanov2023], or volatile fatty acids [@Suhr2015]. The usability of sludges as fertiliser through direct field application [@Yogev2020] or after prior sludge reduction has also been tested [@Monsees2017; @Delaide2017; @Goddek2018; @Lobanov2023]. Saline sludges pose difficulties in this context, as the high salt content was found to inhibit biogas production in some cases [@Zhang2013] and direct land application can lead to soil salinisation [@Li2022].

An important factor that affects the efficiency of \gls{imta} is the availability of nutrients in sufficient quantities and the right stoichiometric ratios [@Nederlof2021]. Studies have shown, for example, that the residues from aquaculture systems are deficient in various nutrients that are essential for plant growth [@Bittsanszky2016; @Lunda2019]. It is therefore worth considering to alter the nutrient input in such a way that the residues are available in quantities and ratios that allow their valorisation with the highest possible efficiency. An obvious approach to achieve this goal is to formulate a feed which, after a proportion of the feed was retained by the fish (or other fed species), provides the optimal conditions for extractive species or sludge utilisation. Aquafeeds are considered the most important source of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus [@Yang2021; @Sugiura2018] into aquaculture systems. This approach was therefore taken up by scholars in the field of aquaponics (the combination of tank-based aquaculture and hydroponics, @Baganz2021), who, by using alternative raw materials, have achieved an increase in the excretion of certain nutrients without jeopardising fish growth [@Seawright1998; @Shaw2022; @Shaw2022a; @Gebauer2023; @Shaw2024]. Interestingly, the claim that feed is the most important source of nutrients in aquaculture systems has never been substantiated to the best of the authors' knowledge. Although a few studies have looked at the contribution of different nutrient sources to the total input [@Delaide2017; @Strauch2018], the results are sometimes contradictory  and cannot be considered representative given the variability of the chemical composition of water. 

Knowing the sources of nutrients, their contribution to the total input and their geographical variability is necessary to find out which substances can actually be effectively controlled in terms of their quantity in the system by targeted input via the feed. For example, the greater the proportion of water in the total input, the greater the increase in the content of the same substance in the feed must be in order to produce a noticeable effect. If the aim is to have a certain amount of one substance or two or more substances present in the system in a certain ratio, this can only be guaranteed if the variability of the input of the same substances from other sources is low. Otherwise, it could be the case that the desired quantity or ratio is only achieved for a small proportion of users (e.g. in a certain geographical region) of the feed. In other places, however, an undersupply of the nutrient in question would still be observed, for example because the water is poorer in the substance. Toxicity could also potentially occur if an unexpected amount of the substance enters the system via other nutrient sources.

The aim of this study is to characterise the nutrient input into closed and semi-open freshwater aquacultures in Europe.  To this end, the most important input routes (feed, water and buffers) are first analysed with regard to their average nutrient loads and variability. The various input routes are then compared with each other in a probabilistic manner and assessed in terms of their importance as input route for particular nutrients that are essential for animals and plants.
The results of this study are an important building block for the development of feeds with which aquaculture can be better integrated into a circular economy. Knowledge about nutrient inputs into aquaculture systems will also be helpful for other fields targeting at valorising aquaculture residues or reducing emissions from aquaculture systems.

# Methodology

## Data acquisition

### Aquafeeds
Nutrient inclusion rates of commercial feeds (n = `r results$n_feeds_commercial`) for Common carp (\emph{Cyprinus carpio}), Pike-perch (\emph{Sander lucioperca}), Nile tilapia (\emph{Oreochromis niloticus}), African catfish (\emph{Clarias gariepinus}), and Rainbow trout (\emph{Oncorhynchus mykiss}) were compiled from feed manufacturer datasheets and `r results$n_feeds_commercial_literature` data records were collected from literature (studies using commercial feeds). In addition, `r results$n_feeds_experimental` records about experimental feeds were collected from literature. To find the mentioned literature studies, Scopus was used with the search terms *aquaculture*, *feed*, *aquaponics*, and *imta* in different combinations. Resulting studies were screened for information regarding the nutrient composition of utilised feeds.


### Water
Tap water analysis reports from locations all over Europe were collected from local authorities and water utilities in the corresponding municipalities. The collected `r results$n_wateranalysis` water analysis reports originated from a total of `r results$n_wateranalysis_countries` countries. It is common to report the value of the instrument detection limit instead of the measured value if the analyte concentration found was below the sensitivity of the measurement instrument [@ISO11843]. This practice is known as data censoring. Retaining these data points in the dataset would have led to an overestimation of plant nutrient concentrations within the tap water. Therefore, mean average nutrient concentrations in tap water were estimated by \gls{mle}, using the *cenmle()* function from the R package NADA [@Helsel2011]. 
In addition, `r results$n_observations_water_rain` rain water analyses were collected from literature. The spatial distribution of the data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:map_water}.

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics{../output/plots/map.png}
  \caption{Geographical distribution of water analysis reports included in the source water dataset. Green: analysis of municipal tap water; Red: rainwater analysis.}
  \label{fig:map_water}
\end{figure}
```


### Alkalinity supplements
The input of alkalinity supplements was estimated based on @Timmons2010, with an amount of \SI{250}{\g} sodium bicarbonate (\ce{NaHCO3}) being recommended per \si{\kg} of feed input. Given the molar mass of \ce{NaHCO3} of $M(\ce{NaHCO3}) = \SI{84.01}{\gmol}$, this would translate into $n = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{\SI{250}{\g}}{\SI{84.01}{\gmol}} = \SI{2.975}{\mol}$ of \ce{HCO3-}, because $n(\ce{HCO3-}) = n(\ce{NaHCO3})$.


## Contribution analysis
\label{sec:method_contribution}
The contribution analysis followed the assumption that the water quality at the chosen location is likely to be subject to comparatively small fluctuations, while the system operator can theoretically choose from any feed available on the market. This feed could be used to fatten a range of fish species which differ in the retention of the nutrients supplied. This results in $n = n_{\text{water}} \cdot n_{\text{feed}} \cdot n_{\text{retention}}$ combinations of water, aquafeeds, and the nutrient retention, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:scheme_combinations}. 

```{=tex}
%\begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics{../latex/permutations.png}
%  \caption{Schematic depiction of the generation of combinations for the %contribution analysis.}
%\end{figure}
```

Both water and aquafeed composition data was based on the metadata gathered as described above. Data from both commercial and experimental feeds was used. Only those substances for which data for both feed and water sources was present were used. The feed input was standardised to $m_{f} = \SI{1}{\kg}$ and three make-up water levels ($V_{w} =  \SI{10}{\L\per\kg}$, \SI{100}{\L\per\kg}, and \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} of feed input) were used. This was assumed as representative for a wide range of fish species [@Dalsgaard2013; @Kloas2015; @Mota2015]. To illustrate the makeup water levels, at a stocking density of $d = \SI{50}{\kg\per\cubicm}$ and a feeding rate of $r_{f} = \SI{2}{\p}$, the resulting system volume would equal to $\frac{m_{f}}{r_{f} \cdot d} \cdot \SI{1000}{\L\per\cubicm} = \SI{1000}{\L}$ and the daily water exchange rates would correspond to \SI{1}{\p}, \SI{10}{\p}, and \SI{100}{\p}, respectively. 

The absolute contributions of water ($a_{w}$) and feed ($a_{f}$) were calculated by multiplying the inputs of feed ($m_{f}$) and water ($V_{w}$) with the corresponding inclusion of each nutrient ($x$) in water ($c_{x}$) and in feed ($\gamma_{x}$). The latter was then multiplied with the possible excretion rates ($r_{e}$), which were computed from nutrient retention rates ($r_{r}$) as $r_{e} = 1 - r_{r}$. Three nutrient retention rates were used, with the mean based on literature data [@Sugiura2018; @Roy2022] and a deviation of $\pm\SI{5}{\p}$ to account for intra- and inter-species variability. Eventually, the absolute contribution of water or feed was converted to its percentage contribution to the total as $p_{(w \lor f)} = \frac{a_{(w \lor f)}}{a_{f} + a_{w}} \cdot \SI{100}{\p}$.


## Statistics and software
All calculations and analyses were done using R (v.4.3.2).
Statistical analyses were conducted if $n > 5$. Pairwise comparisons of means were conducted with t-tests after testing for normality and variance homogeneity using Bartletts test and the Levene test, respectively. 










# Essential nutrients for fish and plants

```{=tex}
\label{sec:essential_nutrients}
```

Fishes as well as plants require a set of elements for the functioning of their metabolism. However, they differ in the mode of uptake, the required elements and their quantities. As the focus of aquaculture is on the fish, feed contains the nutrients that cannot be absorbed in sufficient quantities for optimum growth elsewhere. The content of some of these nutrients, such as crude protein, is clearly defined in the respective feed formulations. Others are added to the feed in standardised mixtures. However, the water is also subject to certain regulations, provided the water source is tap water.However,the water is also subject to certain regulations, provided the water source is tap water. Table \ref{tab:essentials} provides an overview of the essential elements for both fish and plants, and constraints for feed formulation and their concentrations in tap water.

```{=tex}
% list of nutrients for fish and plants, together with those that have to be reported by law
\input{../latex/table_essential_nutrients.tex}
```

Both fishes and plants require carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur as essential building bricks of the cells and for cellular respiration. Further essential macronutrients for both are phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. All organisms require phosphorus as building block for \gls{dna} and \gls{rna} and for energy storage in \gls{atp}. It is also the major constituent of phospholipids that form cell membranes. In fish, phosphorus is, in combination with calcium, required for the development and maintenance of the skeletal system [@Lall2021]. Plants also require calcium for their growth, as biochemical processes such as cell elongation and division are affected by calcium [@Mengel2001].
Magnesium contributes to many biological processes in all organisms, from protein synthesis, over cell replication to the energy metabolism. In fish, it also plays a key role in signal transmission via the nervous system, among others [@Lall2021]. Magnesium is the central atom of chlorophyll in plants and is thus crucial for the functioning of photosynthesis [@Mengel2001].

Essential micronutrients required by both fish and plants are iron, copper, manganese, and zinc. 
Iron and copper are important constituents of many metalloproteins and metalloenzymes, such as heme proteins, cytochromes, among others [@Marschner2012; @Lall2021]. After iron, zinc is the second most abundant micronutrient in living organisms. Even though it is a constituent of metalloenzymes, it does not take part in redox reactions. Instead, it stabilises the enzyme structure [@Lall2021; @Marschner2012]. Manganese is an important co-factor for the activation of enzymes. It is also part of some metalloenzymes [@Marschner2012]. In vertebrates, it is involved in bone mineralisation [@Lall2021]. 

A trace element with proven relevance for fish but without physiological function in plants is iodine. Fish require iodine as constituent of the thyroid hormones that play a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and functioning [@Lall2021].

Plant nutrients that are not essential for fish comprise boron, nickel, molybdenum, and chlorine [@Marschner2012]. Boron has been suggested to have several roles in metabolism, formation of cell wall structure, and substance transport. However, even though required in the largest amounts of all plant micronutrients, the physiological role of boron has not been fully understood [@Marschner2012]. Nickel is another micromineral that was found to be essential, while its functions are not yet fully explored. As transition metal, it is again a constituent of metalloproteins and -enzymes [@Marschner2012]. Molybdenum is mostly involved in the nitrogen metabolism, either as constituent or co-factor of metalloenzymes [@Marschner2012]. Chlorine is an indispensable element for the maintenance of the ion balance and the stabilisation of the membrane potential. Even though considered a micronutrient due to it's low requirement, it is present in amounts that are comparable with macronutrients [@Marschner2012].





# Nutrient inputs into semi-open and closed intensive aquaculture systems
Nutrients can enter aquaculture systems via feed input, water exchange, the addition of chemicals, gas exchange, and natural sources such as leaf litter. However, for the nutrients mentioned in the previous section, with the exception of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, gas exchange is negligible as a route of entry. In closed and, to a certain degree, semi-open systems, natural inputs other than those that are controlled by the operators are negligible as well. 


## Aquafeeds
In order to achieve optimum growth of the cultivated species, a variety of aquafeeds has been developed, which is constantly increasing. The amount of feed depends on the biomass of the animals in the aquaculture facility. Typically, between one and two per cent of the total biomass is added daily in the form of feed.


### Composition of commercial diets and changes over the years
The raw material composition of aquafeeds has changed substantially over time. For instance, the amount of fish meal has been reduced in favor of mostly plant-based ingredients [@MOWI2023]. It could thus be assumed that the inclusion rates of those nutrients that are not kept at constant levels during feed formulation changed as well. However, the most recent general overview study of mineral inclusion rates in aquafeeds dates back more than 40 years [@Tacon1983]. Figure \ref{fig:feedcomp} provides an overview of nutrient inclusion rates compiled from literature studies and feed manufacturer datasheets.

```{r feedcomp, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Inclusion rates of some nutrients essential for fish or plants in different types of aquafeeds. The composition of past feeds is based on data from Tacon, 1983.

Nitrogen and phosphorus are subject of continuous research in the field of fish nutrition because nitrogen in form of \gls{cp} is an important cost factor in feed production. Phosphorus, meanwhile, is problematic because it is present in poorly digestible form in some mostly plant-based raw materials. It is therefore excreted in comparatively large quantities and can, in dependence on the production system, lead to water eutrophication and algae blooms [@Sugiura2018].
As a consequence, nitrogen inclusion rates have decreased from values ranging around \SI{96}{\gkg} (\SI{60}{\p} \gls{cp}) in the early days of aquafeed production to approximately \SI{72}{\gkg} (\SI{45}{\p} \gls{cp}) for salmonid fish [@MOWI2023]. An average of \SI{63.9}{\gkg} (\SI{41.5}{\p} \gls{cp}; \gls{cv} = \SI{18.5}{\p}) is found in feeds for freshwater species such as carp, tilapia, catfish, and percids (n = 74). The range covered was \SIrange{40}{89.6}{\gkg} (\SIrange{250}{560}{\gkg} \gls{cp}). The decrease in nitrogen can be ascribed to discoveries such as the protein sparing effect, for instance in rainbow trout, carp, and tilapia [@Takeuchi1978; @Beamish1986; @Shiau1993] and improvements in the digestibility of aquafeeds. 

In the case of phosphorus, average inclusion rates decreased by about `r round((1-16.252/11.662)*100)`\si{\p}, from \SI{16}{\gkg} to \SI{12}{\gkg} (n = 68). The reduction was achieved by a two-step approach, combining the reduction of dietary phosphorus with efforts to increase its bioavailability in aquafeeds [@Sugiura2018]. Phosphorus addition to feeds is treated restrictively, which is evident from the low variability (\gls{cv} = \SI{21}{\p}).

Information about inclusion rates of other nutrients in commercial standard feeds was found in scientific studies (n = 5). The calcium content of aquafeeds in the collected data (n = 5) is on average `r round((1-22.676/17.56)*100)`\si{\p} lower in comparison with past values. This might be due to the close nutritional relation of calcium with phosphorus and the resulting necessity to maintain an optimum calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the feeds [@Hossain2014]. As a result, the variability of the calcium inclusion is equal to that of phosphorus (\gls{cv} = \SI{21}{\p}).
The magnesium and iron content of aquafeeds, meanwhile, might not have changed. The average magnesium content is \SI{2.2}{\gkg} (n = 3) in comparison with \SI{2.1}{\gkg} in past feeds. On average, \SI{200}{\mgkg} iron is found in aquafeeds (n = 4), even though highly variable (\gls{cv} = \SI{113}{\p}, range \SIrange{40}{544}{\mgkg}). Comparably high variability in iron was already noticed in the past [@Tacon1983].

Nowadays, aquafeeds may contain more copper, zinc, and potassium. The average copper inclusion rate increased by `r round((1-15/20)*100)`\si{\p} (n = 4), with a variability comparable with iron (\gls{cv} = \SI{93}{\p}). In the case of zinc, average inclusion rates are `r round((1-90/207)*100)`\si{\p} higher (n = 4), while `r round((1-9.5/11.2)*100)`\si{\p} more potassium is present in modern commercial aquafeeds (n = 2). The variability is comparable with nitrogen and phosphorus (Zinc: \gls{cv} = \SI{61}{\p}; potassium: \gls{cv} = \SI{20}{\p}).

The authors highlight the lack of mineral composition data in the field of aquaculture nutrition, making a statistically sound comparison between past and present values impossible.


### Speciality feeds
The importance of aquafeeds as nutrient input is reflected by the development of several specialty feeds. For instance, low-pollution feeds have thus been developed that cause reduced nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from pond and cage aquaculture [@Pigott2003; @Millian-Sorribes2021]. \gls{ras} pose similar problems for the aquaculture industry due to high initial and operation costs for water purification systems. Reducing the need for water treatment through the development of aquafeeds with highly bioavailable nutrients or  therefore reduces costs on the long run. Feeds for \gls{imta}, in contrast, are supposed to increase the excretion of specific nutrients. As of now, at least three commercial aquaponics feeds are commercially available. However, according to the datasheets, two out of three feeds do not differ from standard feeds in their phosphorus content. Information with regards to potassium and calcium inclusion rates were reported only for one feed. Here, their inclusion rates were `r (1-20/11)*100`\si{\p} higher and `r (1-15/18)*100`\si{\p} lower than in standard feeds, respectively.


### Experimental feeds
In the recent past, several experiments were conducted to closer examine the extent to which substance excretion patterns by fish are affected by alterations in the raw material composition of aquafeeds [@Gebauer2023; @Shaw2022; @Shaw2022a]. The overall nutrient composition of the experimental diets is comparable with commercially available standard aquafeeds, with no significant differences in average nutrient inclusion levels. Potassium (t-test: p = 0.3), phosphorus (t-test: p = 0.1), calcium (t-test: p = 0.4), and magnesium (t-test: p = 0.7) had average inclusion rates of \SI{9(2.8)}{\gkg}, \SI{14(4.9)}{\gkg}, \SI{15(8.4)}{\gkg}, and \SI{2(0.7)}{\gkg}, respectively.
Also, no differences were found for iron (t-test: p = 0.4), copper (t-test: p = 0.7), and zinc (t-test: p = 0.2). The average inclusion rates were \SI{348(29)}{\mgkg}, \SI{16(2.9)}{\mgkg}, and \SI{93(35.8)}{\mgkg}, respectively.


### Sources of variability
Besides the obviously different nutritional requirements of different fish species, variability in the composition of feed is caused by the natural variability in the composition of feed raw materials. In the past, feed was formulated with a fixed nutrient composition. As fish meal and fish oil made up a large proportion of the feed and the range of other raw materials was small compared to today, it can be assumed that the feed composition and growth performance remained relatively constant.
Nowadays, however, an increasing proportion of fish meal and oil is being replaced by plant-based raw materials for reasons of cost reduction and sustainability. Although the proportion of macronutrients in the feed formulation is kept constant, fish meal replacement has an impact on the remaining, non-fixed nutrients. Figure \ref{fig:feedstuffs} gives an overview of the variability of several substances in different raw materials relevant for aquafeed production (data adapted from @IAFFD2021). For example, the proportion of potassium and zinc in non-marine raw materials is up to ten times lower and the proportion of phosphorus in some plant-based raw materials is up to a hundred times lower than in fish meal. 

The dynamic and more varied composition of the raw materials also has an effect on the digestibility of the feed. Two feeds with an identical proximate composition but different raw material compositions can differ significantly in terms of nutrient digestibility and therefore the growth performance of the fish [@Glencross2020]. For this reason, feeds are no longer formulated on the basis of proximate composition, but on the basis of digestibility. This is the case for current feed formulation approaches such as the Aller Aqua Power2 and PowerRAS concept [@AllerAqua2017; @AllerAqua2019], the Alltech Coppens Net Energy concept [@AlltechCoppens2019], or the Biomar P 3.0 concept [@Biomar2019]. Focusing the feed formulation more closely on the target species thus reduces the predictability of the emissions of non-constrained substances. Considering that the proportion of marine feed components needs to be further reduced in order to achieve a sustainable growth of the aquaculture industry [@Hua2019], a further increasing proportion of alternative raw materials and, along with this, increased variability in other substances can be expected.

### From gross to net feed input
When discussing aquafeeds as nutrient input route into \gls{imta}, it has to be considered that the provided gross feed input does not correspond to the available nutrients for the co-cultivated organisms (see Figure \ref{fig:metabolism}). It must be considered that a fraction of nutrients is retained by the primary species.

```{r include=TRUE, fig.cap="Placeholder showing the metabolic pathways related to fish", out.width="100%", eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("latex", "fish_metabolism.png"))
```

Finfish species cultivated in aquaculture retain about \SI{19}{\p} of the nitrogen [@Fry2018] and \SI{40}{\p} of the phosphorus [@Sugiura2018] that is provided via aquafeeds. Due to the lack of data for other minerals, a conceptual study approximated their retention efficiency from the retention efficiency of ash as sum parameter [@Roy2022].















## Water as nutrient source
The source water of closed and semi-open aquaculture systems can originate from wells, the municipal tap, or surface water such as brooks or rivers [@Timmons2010; @Lawson1995]. In addition, rainwater might cover a share of the water demand in some locations (see e.g., @GallegoAlarcon2019). However, well or tap water is usually preferable as it is usually free of undesired pollutants and pathogens [@Lawson1995]. In the following, the focus is therefore on tap and rain water. 

The amount of water added daily is proportional to the stocking density, the daily feed input, and how efficiently the water can be treated in the system. Usually between 10 and \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} of feed are exchanged [@Dalsgaard2013].

Figure \ref{fig:waters} provides a general overview of the chemical composition of terrestrial waters. Data collected in the scope of the present study is shown in Table \ref{tab:watercomp}. The direct comparison between tap and rain water clearly shows that tap water is significantly richer in ions than rain water. The concentrations of ions found in rain water are in line with what was described as common for continental rain [@Wetzel2011].

Approximately \SI{35}{\p} of the tap water worldwide originates from groundwater sources [@Doell2012]. The composition of tap water is generally comparable to that of groundwater and usually only deviates from it if iron or manganese has to be removed from the raw water before it is fed into the drinking water system. However, it can be argued that large quantities of iron and manganese are also undesirable in the raw water of aquaculture facilities, as they precipitate after oxygenation of the water and can cause damage to pumps and other equipment. Groundwater quality is largely dependent on geochemical processes such as weathering of rock, ion exchange reactions and the build-up of biomass [@Stumm1996], which is also causing spatial variation in the water composition. Temporal fluctuations can be caused by weather events such as heavy rainfall, snowmelt, flooding, or anthropogenic activity, such as agriculture. However, depending on the properties of the soil and the percolation rate of the water, these effects can occur with a time lag.

The variability described above is only reflected to a limited extent in the composition of drinking water in the European Union, as this is regulated by the EU Drinking Water Directive [@EU2020]. A series of limit values (see Table \ref{tab:watercomp}) defines maximum values that should not be exceeded. The limit values for nitrate, nitrite, boron, copper and nickel (specified in Annex I, Part B) are related to potential health hazards. In addition, technical indicator parameters (defined in Annex I, Part C) regulate the pH, conductivity, ammonium, iron, manganese, sulfur (as sulphate), sodium and chloride content of the water to ensure the longevity of the drinking water system.

Compared to groundwater, rain water is poor in ions, as these do not pass into the gas phase during the evaporation of water. However, salt particles in the air can act as nuclei for raindrop formation and eventually dissolve in the water. In close proximity to the sea, sea spray is an important source of those particles. However, a significant proportion also originates from anthropogenic air pollution [@Wetzel2011].

## Alkalinity supplements as nutrient sources
The term alkalinity supplements summarises several alkaline substances that are used to maintain a stable pH in the water of closed and semi-open aquaculture systems. Fishes excrete ammonia as a metabolic end product, which then forms ammonium after reaction with water. Ammonium is then converted to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria in the biofilter. The conversion of ammonium to nitrate follows the overall simplified reaction depicted in Equation \ref{eq:nitrification} [@Timmons2010].

\begin{align}
  \ce{NH4+} + 2\ce{O2} + \ce{H2O} -> \ce{NO3-} + 2{H3O+}
  \label{eq:nitrification}
\end{align}

Per mole of converted ammonium, two moles of hydronium ions are released. This results in a steady drop of the pH towards regions in which the metabolic activity of the nitrifiers is inhibited [@Ward2011]. As countermeasure, a range of alkalinity supplements is used (see Table \ref{tab:alkalinity}). While sodium bicarbonate (\ce{NaHCO3}) is often used in \gls{ras}, liming with calcium carbonate (\ce{CaCO3}) is common practice in pond aquaculture [@Boyd2016].

```{=tex}
\input{../latex/table_alkalinitysuppl.tex}
```

It can be derived from equation \ref{eq:nitrification} that the amount of hydronium ions to be neutralised is proportional to the amount of nitrogen input from the feed. As a rule of thumb, \SI{4.7}{\g} of alkalinity as \ce{CaCO3} needs to be provided per \si{\g} of \gls{tan}. 
Alkalinity supplements play a special role with regard to nutrient input, as they contribute only one nutrient to the system in addition to their function as alkalinity suppliers. The proportion of this nutrient is therefore very high compared to the contribution of the feed or water. The variability is negligible, as the added substances are of comparably high purity [@Boyd2016].








# Drawing the big picture
In the previous sections, it was analysed which quantities of substances of interest for integrated aquaculture can be expected in the most important inputs of an aquaculture facility and how variable they are. However, the proportions of nutrients in the individual material flows do not yet allow any statement to be made about their relevance for the overall nutrient budget of the aquaculture systems under consideration. For this reason, the data collected is compared by contribution analysis.


## Contribution of nutrient sources to the total nutrient mass flows
The outcomes of the contribution analysis (see Figure \ref{fig:combinations}) clearly show large differences in the share of the total nutrient input and also the variability of the share to be expected. Overall, it is not surprising to find that the proportion of nutrients supplied by the water increases with increasing amounts of supplementary water and that the proportion of nutrients is higher when tap water is used than when rainwater is used.

It can be stated that the proportion of phosphorus added to the system via tap water is negligible. The highest contribution was found not to exceed \SI{5}{\p}, thus corroborating literature [@Sugiura2018]. In some cases, however, rainwater can certainly be responsible for comparatively large amounts of phosphorus input. In 40% of the scenarios created, between \SI{6}{\p} and up to \SI{57}{\p} of the phosphorus originated from rainwater. These unexpectedly high values could be due to air pollution and the comparably small sample size with regards to rain water reports included into the dataset. A high temporal variability of the phosphorus concentration in rainwater was described in other studies [@Migon1999].




median of the tap water contribution increased in the order phosphorus (\SI[round-mode=places,round-precision=2]{0.034}{\p}) < zinc (\SI[round-mode=places,round-precision=1]{2.391}{\p}) < iron (\SI[round-mode=places,round-precision=1]{2.788}{\p}) < potassium (\SI[round-mode=places,round-precision=1]{3.844}{\p}) < nitrogen (\SI[round-mode=places,round-precision=1]{7.741}{\p}), copper (\SI[round-mode=places,round-precision=1]{11.722}{\p}) < sulfur (\SI[round-mode=places,round-precision=1]{16.750}{\p}) < calcium (\SI[round-mode=places,round-precision=1]{34.514}{\p}) < magnesium (\SI[round-mode=places,round-precision=1]{50.562}{\p}). 

The high variability in the results is confirmed by other studies that have found, for example, a proportion of calcium, magnesium and sulphur in the water of around \SI{30}{\p} and more than \SI{70}{\p}, respectively [@Strauch2018; @Delaide2017].

Nutrient contributions of rain water are comparably low in all cases, being below \SI{12}{\p} in all cases for nitrogen, zinc, magnesium, potassium, copper, and phosphorus and below \SI{37}{\p} for calcium, iron, and sulfur. However, in \SI{80}{\p} of the cases, the contribution for all nutrients is expected to be below approximately \SI{10}{\p}. 

```{r combinations, include=TRUE, fig.cap="The graph shows the probability that the exchange water (provided in L per kg of feed fed) contributes a specified proportion of a nutrient in a closed or semi-open freshwater aquaculture system in Europe to the overall nutrient input. The corresponding contribution of feed can be calculated as follows: %Feed = 100% - %Water.

knitr::include_graphics(here("output", "plots", "combination_combined_ridgeddensity_multiple.png"))
```



Figure \ref{fig:variability} clearly depicts that tap water is the predominant source of variability in the results. Except for iron, copper, and zinc in cases were rainwater is the sole water source, the variability found in the data was at least \SI{60}{\p} greater for the water than for the feed. The greatest differences between variabilities of feed and water were found for phophorus, potassium, magnesium, and copper in case of tap water and nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in case of rain water.

## Implications for nutrient management
The results of the contribution analysis allow a number of conclusions to be drawn regarding the utilisation and further development of various nutrient input routes in aquaculture systems.


### Feeds
The most important aspect for \gls{imta} is reproducibility. I must be sure that I can reproduce good results over time. I cannot do anything against spatial variability, but I can avoid temporal variability, because this is what makes continuous monitoring necessary, if the goal was maximum efficiency of the entire system and not only of the fish production.

Temporal variability most likely originates from changes in the feed composition between batches. With regards to feed formulation approaches, it might be more reasonable to target a fixed raw material composition for \gls{imta} feeds. This would reduce temporal variability by ensuring that variability comes from the natural variability of raw materials alone and not, in addition, varying inclusion rates. However, the question is whether the variability originates from the raw materials or their inclusion rates.


The production of a special feed for integrated aquaculture harbours potential for increasing the efficiency of these systems. However, it must be guaranteed in advance that this feed will achieve the desired result in the majority of applications. With regard to a targeted nutrient supply for secondary organisms, this means that the sum of nutrients from all sources must always be within certain limits so that nutrient deficiencies do not persist despite a potentially more expensive feed or an oversupply of nutrients does not cause toxicity.
The present study shows that the manipulation of the assessed minerals (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Cu, Zn) via feed is possible, if the main water source was rain water. Rain water is comparably poor in the mentioned compounds, contributing not more than \SI{10}{\p} of their total input into the system. An increase in the inclusion rate of a mineral in the feed by \SI{10}{\p} would thus result in an increase in the total input by \SI{9}{\p}.

If the main water source is tap water, the safest choice for feed manipulation would be to focus on nitrogen and phosphorus only. The contribution of the water source to the phosphorus budget has been found to be, overall, negligible (< \SI{0.5}{\p}). It can also not be expected that more than approximately \SI{10}{\p} of the total nitrogen input will originate from the water at this point.


it is feasible in \SI{60}{\p} of the cases to alter the concentrations of N, P, K, Fe, Zn via feed.



Copper was found to be highly variable both in water and feeds.  Attempts to increase the copper inclusion rate in feeds might result in toxicity, either for the fed livestock or for secondary organisms.

Calcium is abundant in tap water and highly variable in its contribution; increase of Ca in feed might lead to precipitation








### Alkalinity supplements
- K salts suitable and required in comparably small doses
- Ca salts also suitable in general, but interaction with phosphorus needs to be taken into account. 







# Conclusion
At this stage, the successful formulation of a general all-purpose fish feed for integrated freshwater aquaculture systems seems unrealistic. The variability in the chemical composition of the water among locations prohibits generalisations that reach beyond nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc.
