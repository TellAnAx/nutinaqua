# Introduction
Compared to land animal husbandry, aquaculture faces particular challenges that are caused by the water as a habitat for the farmed animals. In water, solid excreta are directly exposed to dissolution processes and microbial degradation, as long as they are not removed by means of mechanical filtration. Meanwhile, water-soluble substances from feces decomposition, branchial or urinary excretion are highly diluted in the system water. Discharging this nutritious water is problematic from an environmental perspective (e.g., @Sugiura2018), but also with regard to the efficient utilization of finite raw materials. Several concepts exist where those nutrients are valorized *in situ*, such as the nutritious pond concept [@Joffre2019], fish-rice co-culture [@Halwart2004], or aquaponics [@Goddek2019]. All of these concepts combine aspects of circular economy, which is nowadays even more in the focus of the scientific community and the general public due to growing world population, climate change and resource scarcity being omnipresent in the media and addressed by policy makers worldwide, for instance in form of the EU Green Deal [@EU2015].

One of the factors affecting the total efficiency (*ergo*, the yield of all targeted system outputs) of these co-cultivation systems is the availability of the most limited nutrient [@Nederlof2021]. Imbalances of nutrients are considered an important issue in aquaponics [@Bittsanszky2016; @Seawright1998]. In closed and semi-open intensive systems where the majority of substance inputs stems from human activity, the approach of choice is usually to formulate a dedicated feed as simple control measure. However, if the aim is to provide optimum conditions for organisms that absorb nutrients in dissolved form, it is necessary not to neglect nutrient sources other than the feed, their contribution to the nutrient budget and also their variability. Otherwise, optimum values might be missed or even critical values could be reached if the total nutrient concentration is too high or too low in individual cases due to extreme values of another nutrient source.

```

The objective of this study is to assess the nutrient budget of aquaculture systems with regards to the expected contributions and variabilities in nutrients originating from aquafeeds, alkalinity supplements, and source water. Emphasis is given to plant nutrients as their successful management is crucial for the functioning of integrated systems such as aquaponics. Expanding the body of knowledge with regards to this aspect is thus expected to contribute to improvements of these food production systems by further advancing means of nutrient management.










# Methodology

## Aquafeeds


\begin{equation}
  m_{in,true} = m_{in,total} \cdot r_{feed} \cdot \gamma_{X} \cdot \text{ADC}_{X} \cdot r_{ex,diss}
  \label{eq:feed_input}
\end{equation}



## Alkalinity supplements
The input of alkalinity supplements was estimated based on @Timmons2010, with an amount of \SI{250}{\g} sodium bicarbonate (\ce{NaHCO3}) being recommended per \si{\kg} of feed input. Given the molar mass of \ce{NaHCO3} of $M(\ce{NaHCO3}) = \SI{84.01}{\gmol}$, this would translate into $n = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{\SI{250}{\g}}{\SI{84.01}{\gmol}} = \SI{2.975}{\mol}$ of \ce{HCO3-}, because $n(\ce{HCO3-}) = n(\ce{NaHCO3})$.  








# Essential nutrients for fish and plants

```{=tex}
\label{sec:essential_nutrients}
```

Fishes as well as plants require a set of elements that have to be provided via the diet or nutrient solution and can be divided into macro- and micronutrients, according to their required quantities. However, they differ both in the required elements and their abundance. Table \ref{tab:essentials} provides an overview of the essential nutrients.

Both fishes and plants require carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur as essential building bricks of the cells and for cellular respiration in large quantities. 

Further essential macronutrients for both are phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. 
All organisms require phosphorus as essential building block for their \gls{dna} and \gls{rna} and for the storage of energy in form of \gls{atp}. It is also the major constituent of phospholipids that form cell membranes. In fish, phosphorus is, in combination with calcium, required for the development and maintenance of the skeletal system [@Lall2021]. Plants also require calcium for their growth, as biochemical processes such as cell elongation and division are affected by calcium [@Mengel2001].
Magnesium contributes to many biological processes in all organisms, from protein synthesis, over cell replication to the energy metabolism. In fish, it also plays a key role in signal transmission via the nervous system, among others [@Lall2021]. Magnesium is the central atom of chlorophyll in plants and is thus crucial for the functioning of photosynthesis [@Mengel2001].

Essential micronutrients required by both fish and plants are iron, copper, manganese, and zinc. 
Iron and copper are important constituents of many metalloproteins and metalloenzymes, such as heme proteins, cytochromes, among others [@Marschner2012; @Lall2021]. After iron, zinc is the second most abundant micronutrient in living organisms. Even though it is a constituent of metalloenzymes, it does not take part in redox reactions. Instead, it stabilises the enzyme structure [@Lall2021; @Marschner2012]. Manganese is an important co-factor for the activation of enzymes. It is also part of some metalloenzymes [@Marschner2012]. In vertebrates, it is involved in bone mineralisation [@Lall2021]. 

A trace elements with proven relevance for fish but without physiological function in plants is iodine. Fish require iodine as constituent of the thyroid hormones that play a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and functioning [@Lall2021].

Meanwhile, essential plant nutrients that are not essential for fish comprise boron, nickel, molybdenum, and chlorine [@Marschner2012].
Boron has been suggested to have several roles in metabolism, formation of cell wall structure, and substance transport. However, even though required in the largest amounts of all plant micronutrients, the physiological role of boron has not been fully understood [@Marschner2012]. Nickel is another micromineral that was found to be essential, while its functions are not yet fully explored. As transition metal, it is again a constituent of metalloproteins and -enzymes [@Marschner2012]. Molybdenum is mostly involved in the nitrogen metabolism, either as constituent or co-factor of metalloenzymes [@Marschner2012]. Chlorine is an indispensable element for the maintenance of the ion balance and the stabilisation of the membrane potential. Even though considered a micronutrient due to it's low requirement, it is present in amounts that are comparable with macronutrients [@Marschner2012].

# Nutrient inputs into semi-open and closed aquaculture systems

## Aquafeeds

### Nutrient composition and changes over the years
Aquafeeds are considered the most important nutrient input into aquaculture systems. Studies comparing nutrient inputs from aquafeeds versus source water in aquaponics found that they are the dominant source of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, manganese, copper, zinc, and molybdenum [@Delaide2017]. Another study found that also the majority of calcium, magnesium, and sulfur originated from the feed [@Strauch2018]. However, the most recent general overview study of mineral inclusion rates in aquafeeds dates back more than 40 years [@Tacon1983]. In the meantime, the raw material composition of aquafeeds has changed substantially. For instance, the amount of fish meal has been reduced in favor of mostly plant-based ingredients [@MOWI2023]. It could thus be assumed that the inclusion rates of those nutrients that are not controlled during aquafeed formulation changed as well. Figure \ref{fig:feedcomp} provides an overview of nutrient inclusion rates compiled from literature studies and feed manufacturer datasheets.

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics{../output/plots/feed.png}
  \caption{Inclusion rates of some nutrients essential for fish or plants in different types of aquafeeds. The composition of "past" feeds is based on data from Tacon, 1983. Data about "present" aquafeeds was compiled from datasheets and scientific publications providing analyses of commercial aquafeeds for Rainbow trout (\emph{Oncorhynchus mykiss}), Common carp (\emph{Cyprinus carpio}), Pike-perch (\emph{Sander lucioperca}), Nile tilapia (\emph{Oreochromis niloticus}), and African catfish (\emph{Clarias gariepinnus}). The dataset includes starter and grower feeds. "Experimental" feeds were those specifically formulated for studies related to aquaponics. "Aquaponic" feeds comprise commercially available feeds (n = 3) for aquaponic systems.}
  \label{fig:feedcomp}
\end{figure}
```

Nitrogen and phosphorus are subject of continuous research in the field of fish nutrition because nitrogen in form of \gls{cp} is an important cost factor in feed production. Phosphorus, meanwhile, is problematic because it is present in poorly digestible form in some mostly plant-based raw materials. It is therefore excreted in comparatively large quantities and can, in dependence on the production system, lead to water eutrophication and algae blooms [@Sugiura2018].
As a consequence, nitrogen inclusion rates have decreased from values ranging around \SI{96}{\gkg} (\SI{60}{\p} \gls{cp}) in the early days of aquafeed production to approximately \SI{72}{\gkg} (\SI{45}{\p} \gls{cp}) for salmonid fish [@MOWI2023]. An average of \SI{63}{\gkg} (\SI{45}{\p} \gls{cp}) is found in feeds for freshwater species such as carp, tilapia, catfish, and percids (n = 74). The decrease in nitrogen can be ascribed to discoveries such as the protein sparing effect, for instance in rainbow trout, carp, and tilapia [@Takeuchi1978; @Beamish1986; @Shiau1993] and improvements in the digestibility of aquafeeds. 
In the case of phosphorus, average inclusion rates decreased by about `r round((1-16.252/11.662)*100)`\si{\p}, from \SI{16}{\gkg} to \SI{12}{\gkg} (n = 68). The reduction was achieved by a two-step approach, combining the reduction of dietary phosphorus with efforts to increase its bioavailability in aquafeeds [@Sugiura2018]. 

Information about inclusion rates of other nutrients in commercial standard feeds was found in scientific studies (n = 5). The calcium content of aquafeeds in the collected data (n = 5) is on average `r round((1-22.676/17.56)*100)`\si{\p} lower in comparison with past values. This might be due to the close nutritional relation of calcium with phosphorus and the resulting necessity to maintain an optimum calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the feeds [@Hossain2014]. The magnesium and iron content of aquafeeds, meanwhile, might not have changed. The average magnesium content is \SI{2.2}{\gkg} (n = 3) in comparison with \SI{2.1}{\gkg} in past feeds. On average, \SI{200}{\mgkg} iron is found in aquafeeds (n = 4), even though highly variable (cv = \SI{113}{\p}, range \SIrange{40}{544}{\mgkg}). Variability in iron was already noticed in the past [@Tacon1983].

Nowadays, aquafeeds may contain more zinc (n = 4), copper (n = 4), and potassium (n = 2). In the case of zinc, average inclusion rates are `r round((1-90/207)*100)`\si{\p} higher in modern feeds. The average copper inclusion rate increased by `r round((1-15/20)*100)`\si{\p}, while `r round((1-9.5/11.2)*100)`\si{\p} more potassium is present in modern commercial aquafeeds. Data is highly variable, with a \gls{cv} of \SI{61}{\p} and \SI{93}{\p} for zinc and copper, respectively, and a \gls{cv} of \SI{20}{\p} for potassium.

The authors highlight the lack of mineral composition data in the field of aquaculture nutrition, making a statistically sound comparison between past and present values impossible.





### Variability through changing nutrient inclusion rates - Speciality feeds
The variability found in the results can be traced back to 

- differences between the nutritional requirements of fish species for which the feeds in the dataset were formulated

- carnivorus fish need more protein, thus more N, thus less other nutrients and different feed ingredient composition, thus changes in the nutrient composition.
- there is, obviously, a variety of fish feeds on the market that have different formulations


- Feed formulators need to react to fluctuations of market prices for raw materials and the natural variation in raw material composition. 
- fish feed composition will have to change to reduce the forage fish demand, making aquaculture more sustainable and fit for the future [@Cottrell2020]. 
- it was shown that differences in raw material composition lead to comparable growth but the nutrient composition can dramatically vary







The importance of aquafeeds as nutrient input is reflected by the development of several commercial specialty feeds. For instance, low-pollution feeds have thus been developed that cause reduced nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from pond and cage aquaculture [@Pigott2003; @Millian-Sorribes2021]. \gls{ras} pose similar problems for the aquaculture industry due to high initial and operation costs for water purification systems. Reducing the need for water treatment through the development of highly bioavailable aquafeeds therefore reduces costs on the long run. 

Feeds for integrated systems such as aquaponics, in contrast, are supposed to increase the excretion of specific nutrients. Although this approach runs counter to the usual logic of reducing emissions from aquaculture, it could be a feasible way to counteract nutrient deficiencies in secondary organisms such as plants. For instance, the formulation of a feed for aquaponics was proposed to provide an “off-the-shelf” nutrient delivery system without additional management effort for aquaponics farmers [@Seawright1998; @Lennard2017; @Eck2019]. Achieving higher nutrient excretion is possible, for instance, by using feed additives or feed ingredients that provoke the excretion of higher amounts of certain nutrients. 
Figure \@ref{fig:feedstuffs} gives an overview of the variability of several substances in different feedstuffs relevant for aquafeed production (data originating from @IAFFD2021). The replacement of marine feed ingredients in aquafeeds by novel protein sources such as plant- or insect-based feedstuffs is necessary in order to meet sustainability goals [@Hua2019; @Gasco2020]. 


In the recent past, several experiments were conducted to closer examine the extent to which substance excretion patterns by fish are affected by alterations in the raw material composition of aquafeeds [@Gebauer2023; @Shaw2022; @Shaw2022a]. The overall nutrient composition of the experimental diets is comparable with commercially available aquafeeds, with no significant differences in average nutrient inclusion levels. Potassium (t-test: p = 0.3), phosphorus (t-test: p = 0.1), calcium (t-test: p = 0.4), and magnesium (t-test: p = 0.7) had average inclusion rates of \SI{9(2.8)}{\gkg}, \SI{14(4.9)}{\gkg}, \SI{15(8.4)}{\gkg}, and \SI{2(0.7)}{\gkg}, respectively.
Also, no differences were found for iron (t-test: p = 0.4), copper (t-test: p = 0.7), and zinc (t-test: p = 0.2). The average inclusion rates were \SI{348(29)}{\mgkg}, \SI{16(2.9)}{\mgkg}, and \SI{93(35.8)}{\mgkg}, respectively.



At least three commercial aquaponics feeds are already on the market. However, according to the datasheets, two out of three feeds do not differ from standard feeds in their phosphorus content. Information with regards to potassium and calcium inclusion rates were reported only for one feed. Here, their inclusion rates were `r (1-20/11)*100`\si{\p} higher and `r (1-15/18)*100`\si{\p} lower than in standard feeds, respectively.

```





### From gross to net feed input
When discussing aquafeeds as nutrient input route into integrated systems, it has to be considered that the gross feed input that is provided is not what is available for the secondary organisms that are co-cultivated in an integrated system (see Figure \@ref{fig:metabolism. Instead, the retention of a fraction of nutrients by the livestock must be considered [@Robaina2019].

```{r include=TRUE, fig.cap="Placeholder showing the metabolic pathways related to fish", out.width="100%", eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("latex", "fish_metabolism.png"))
```

Finfish species cultivated in aquaculture retain about \SI{19}{\p} of the nitrogen [@Fry2018] and \SI{40}{\p} of the phosphorus [@Sugiura2018] that is provided via aquafeeds. Due to the lack of data for other minerals, a conceptual study approximated their retention efficiency from the retention efficiency of ash as sum parameter [@Roy2022].


























## Water as nutrient source
Water is usually regarded as comparatively unimportant in terms of nutrient input in aquaculture systems, while the main focus is on feed (see e.g., @Schmautz2016, @Sugiura2018). While this assertion is valid from a water chemistry point of view for certain nutrients, it may not be universally valid for others and requires systematic investigation.
The source water for aquaculture systems can originate from wells, surface water such as brooks or rivers, or the municipal tap. In addition, rainwater can cover a share of the water demand in some locations. \gls{ras} or integrated systems such as aquaponics might be especially suitable for water-scarce regions [@Joyce2019] or urban areas [@Junge2017], where restrictive water management by authorities can be expected. At these locations, tap water is likely the most important water source. Recent surveys corroborate this assumption for the field of aquaponics, as the results show that the proportion of aquaponic practicioners using municipal tap water in the USA and Europe is \SI{47}{\p} and \SI{71.7}{\p}, respectively [@Pattillo2022; @Raulier2023]. 

Tap water is similar to groundwater in terms of its chemical composition. Approximately \SI{35}{\p} of the tap water worldwide originates from groundwater sources [@Doell2012]. 



The quality of groundwater is largely dependent on geochemical processes such as weathering of rock [@Stumm1996]. Surface waters are more variable in their chemical composition, as they are in contact with the atmosphere and biological processes can take place due to the exposure to sunlight and input of substances from the environment, which allows, for instance, photosynthesis. 

A general overview of the composition of terrestrial waters is provided in Figure \ref{fig:waters}.

```{r waters, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Cumulative frequency distribution of chemical compounds in terrestrial waters. X-axis: logarithmic concentration of compounds. 1 ppm = 1 mg/L. Y-axis: Percentage of sampling points (Stumm and Morgan, 1996)."}
knitr::include_graphics(here("latex", "waters.png"))
```

For further analyses, tap water analysis reports from locations all over Europe were collected from local authorities and water utilities in the corresponding municipalities. The collected `r results$n_wateranalysis` water analysis reports originated from a total of `r results$n_wateranalysis_countries` countries. In addition, rain water analysis reports were collected from literature. The spatial distribution of the data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:map_water}. 

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics{../output/plots/map.png}
  \caption{Geographical distribution of water analysis reports included in the source water dataset. Green: analysis of municipal tap water; Red: rainwater analysis.}
  \label{fig:map_water}
\end{figure}
```

In water analysis, it is common practice to report the value of the instrument detection limit instead of the measured value in case that the analyte concentration found was below the sensitivity of the measurement instrument [@ISO11843]. This practice is known as data censoring and used to ensure that the analyte signal can be distinguished from the instruments signal noise with satisfying confidence. However, retaining these data points in the dataset leads to incorrect results as the true concentration is within the interval from zero to the detection limit. To avoid an overestimation of plant nutrient concentrations within the tap water, true means from censored data were estimated by \gls{mle}, using the \emph{cenmle()} function from the R package NADA [@Helsel2011]. The resulting data is shown in Table \ref{tab:watercomp}. The direct comparison between tap water and rainwater clearly shows that tap water is significantly richer in ions.

```{r watercomp, include=TRUE}
knitr::kable(read_csv(here("output", "tables", "water_combined.csv")),
             caption = "Concentrations of substances relevant for plant production in tap water samples from Europe. Tap water means were calculated from censored data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Tests for significance were conducted by comparing the resulting 95% confidence interval for tap water data with the means of the rain water.")
```





## Sources and extent of variability
Water can vary both spatially and temporally in its composition, depending on where it is sourced. Tap water can originate from natural springs, ground-, or surface water, where it was in contact with solids or gases for a prolonged period of time. 

The spatial variation of water is caused, for instance, by the properties of the aquifer. An important process that affects the composition of spring- and groundwater is weathering of rock, ion exchange, and the buildup of biomass [@Stumm1996]. In regions where water originates from surface water such as rivers or lakes, gas exchange and resulting chemical reactions, for instance redox reactions with oxygen, are affecting the composition of the water. Temporal variation can be caused by weather events such as heavy rain, snow melting, floods, or anthropogenic inputs such as agricultural activity. 



In the European Union, the composition of tap water is regulated by the EU Drinking Water Directive [@EU2020]. A set of threshold values (see Table \ref{tab:watercomp}) ensures that the water is safe for lifelong human consumption and fulfills technical requirements. The limits for nitrate, nitrite, boron, copper, and nickel (stated in Annex I, Part B) are related to potential health hazards. In addition, technical indicator parameters (defined in Annex I, Part C) regulate the pH, conductivity, ammonium, iron, manganese, sulfur (sulphate), sodium, and chloride levels of the water to ensure longevity of the drinking water system.













# Drawing the big picture
In the previous sections, it was analysed which quantities of substances of interest for integrated aquaculture can be expected in the most important inputs of an aquaculture facility and how variable they are. In order to be able to make a statement about how this affects the nutrient budget of an aquaculture facility, further considerations must be made. 

## Contribution of the nutrient sources to the total nutrient mass flows
It can initially be assumed that a hypothetical integrated aquaculture facility can be built anywhere in Europe. While the water quality at the chosen location is likely to be subject to comparatively small fluctuations, the system operator can theoretically choose from any feed available on the market. This feed could be used to fatten a range of fish species relevant to aquaculture, which in turn differ in the retention of the nutrients supplied. This results in a number $n$ of combinations of water, aquafeeds, and the nutrient retention, that can be calculated as $n = n_{\text{water}} \cdot n_{\text{feed}} \cdot n_{\text{retention}}$ (see Figure \@ref{scheme_combinations}). After defining a representative water exchange rate per unit mass of feed input, the combinations can be used to make a statement about the extent to which the supplied water and feed contribute to the nutrient input into aquaculture systems. 

```{r scheme_combinations, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Schematic explanation of the creation of combinations.",out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("latex", "permutations.png"))
```

In the present study, we standardised the feed input to $m_{f} = \SI{1}{\kg}$. Both water and aquafeed composition data was based on the metadata presented in this study. Data from both commercial and experimental feeds was used and a make-up water volume of $V_{w} = \SI{100}{\L\per\kg}$ of feed input was assumed. At a stocking density of $d = \SI{50}{\kg\per\cubicm}$ and a feeding rate of $r_{f} = \SI{2}{\p}$, the resulting system volume would equal to $\frac{m_{f}}{r_{f} \cdot d} \cdot 1000 \si{\L\per\cubicm} = \SI{1000}{\L}$. Considering the make-up water input, this would correspond to a daily water exchange rate of \SI{10}{\p}. The absolute contributions of water $a_{w}$  and feed $a_{f}$ was calculated by multiplying the inputs of feed ($m_{f} = \SI{1}{\kg}$) and water ($V_{w} = \SI{100}{\L}$) with the corresponding inclusion of each nutrient $x$ in water ($c_{x}$) and in feed ($\gamma_{x}$). The latter was then multiplied with the possible excretion rates $r_{e}$, which was computed from the nutrient retention as $r_{e} = 1 - r_{r}$. Three nutrient retention rates were used, with the mean based on literature data [@Sugiura2018; @Roy2022] and a deviation of $\pm\SI{5}{\p}$. Eventually, the absolute contribution of water or feed can be converted to its percentage contribution to the total as $p_{w \lor f} = \frac{a_{w \lor f}}{a_{f} + a_{w}} \cdot \SI{100}{\p}$.

Following the described logic, density plots were generated for the resulting outputs, distinguishing between tap and rain water (see Figure \@ref{fig:combinations}). 

```{r combinations, include=TRUE, fig.cap="The graph shows the probability that the exchange water (provided in L per kg of feed fed) contributes a specified proportion of a nutrient in a closed or semi-open aquaculture system anywhere in Europe to the overall nutrient input. The corresponding contribution of feed can be calculated as follows: %Feed = 100% - %Water. Data (n = 5000) was generated by permutations of feed composition data (n between 2 and 70), three different nutrient retention levels per nutrient, and water composition data (n = 60).", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("output", "plots", "combination_combined_ridgeddensity_multiple.png"))
```

The outcomes clearly show differences in the share of the total nutrient input and also the variability of the share to be expected between water sources and nutrients. Nutrient contributions of rain water are comparably low in all cases, being below \SI{12}{\p} in all cases for nitrogen, zinc, magnesium, potassium, copper, and phosphorus and below \SI{37}{\p} for calcium, iron, and sulfur. However, in \SI{80}{\p} of the cases, the contribution for all nutrients is expected to be below approximately \SI{10}{\p}. 


The median of the tap water contribution increased in the order phosphorus (\SI{0.034}{\p}) < zinc (\SI{2.391}{\p}) < iron (\SI{2.788}{\p}) < potassium (\SI{3.844}{\p}) < nitrogen (\SI{7.741}{\p}), copper (\SI{11.722}{\p}) < sulfur (\SI{16.750}{\p}) < calcium (\SI{34.514}{\p}) < magnesium (\SI{50.562}{\p}). 

The high variability in the results is confirmed by other studies that have found, for example, a proportion of calcium, magnesium and sulphur in the water of around \SI{30}{\p} and more than \SI{70}{\p}, respectively [@Strauch2018; @Delaide2017].





# Alkalinity supplements as nutrient sources
Alkalinity supplements play a special role with regards to nutrient inputs. Thus, they will be treated separately.

The term alkalinity supplements summarises several alkaline substances that are used to maintain a stable pH in the water. The pH in aquaculture systems decreases over time due to the activity of nitrifying bacteria in the biofilter. The conversion of ammonium to nitrate follows the overall simplified reaction equation \ref{eq:nitrification} [@Timmons2010].

\begin{align}
  \ce{NH4+} + 2\ce{O2} + \ce{H2O} -> \ce{NO3-} + 2{H3O+}
  \label{eq:nitrification}
\end{align}

Per mole of ammonium (\ce{NH4+}) that is converted to nitrate (\ce{NO3-}), two moles of hydronium ions (\ce{H3O+}) are released. The decrease in pH causes a decrease in the activity of nitrifyers [Ward2011] and has to be counteracted.

Furthermore, it can be derived from equation \ref{eq:nitrification} that $n(\ce{NH4+})) = n(\ce{N})$ and $2n(\ce{N}) = n(\ce{H3O+})$. Thus, the amount of moles that have to be neutralized can be calculated from the feed input as shown in equation \ref{eq:nitrification_feed}

\begin{align}
  n(\ce{H3O+}) = 2\frac{m(\ce{N})}{M(\ce{N})}
  \label{eq:nitrification_feed}
\end{align}

with the molar mass $M(\ce{N}) = \SI{14.007}{\gmol}$. Sodium based substances such as sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda, \ce{NaHCO3}) are commonly used in aquaculture due to their high and rapid solubility at a comparably cheap price. The chemical reaction with bases such as \ce{NaHCO3}, \ce{KOH}  or \ce{Ca(HCO3)2} is eventually a simple neutralization reaction of the pattern


The mass of sodium, potassium or calcium can consequently be calculated by rearranging equation (2.4) and using the correct stoichiometric conversion factor. High sodium concentrations must be avoided in aquaponic systems due to its phytotoxicity [@Maathuis2014]. Sodium is therefore replaced with several other supplements based on potassium or calcium that come with the benefit of providing an additional source of nutrients besides increasing the pH.

Thus, a stable pH has to be maintained to ensure both high nitrification performance and animal welfare. For this purpose, several Na-based substances such as sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda, \ce{NaHCO3}) are commonly used in aquaculture due to their high and rapid solubility at a comparably cheap price. However, high sodium concentrations must be avoided in aquaponic systems due to its phytotoxicity [@Maathuis2014]. Sodium is therefore replaced with several other supplements based on potassium or calcium that come with the benefit of providing an additional source of nutrients besides increasing the pH.








# Implications for nutrient management

- manipulation of all nutrients via feed possible, if main water source was rain water 
- manipulation of N, P, K, Fe, Zn via feed, if main water source was tap water in 60% of the cases
- Cu highly variable in water; attempts to increase Cu in feed might result in toxicity, either for the fed livestock or for the secondary organisms
- Ca is abundant in tap water and highly variable in its contribution; increase of Ca in feed might lead to precipitation










## Other implications


# Conclusion
This article provides a synthesis of information concerning the sources of nutrients in aquaculture and aquaponic systems, their contribution to the total daily nutrient mass flows and their variability.
