# Introduction
Compared to land animal husbandry, aquaculture faces particular challenges that are caused by the water as a habitat for the farmed animals. In water, solid excreta are directly exposed to dissolution processes and microbial degradation, as long as they are not removed by means of mechanical filtration. Meanwhile, water-soluble substances from feces decomposition, branchial or urinary excretion are highly diluted in the system water. Discharging this nutritious water is problematic from an environmental perspective (e.g., @Sugiura2018), but also with regard to the efficient utilization of finite raw materials. Several concepts exist where those nutrients are valorized *in situ*, such as the nutritious pond concept [@Joffre2019], fish-rice co-culture [@Halwart2004], or aquaponics [@Goddek2019]. All of these concepts combine aspects of circular economy, which is nowadays even more in the focus of the scientific community and the general public due to growing world population, climate change and resource scarcity being omnipresent in the media and addressed by policy makers worldwide, for instance in form of the EU Green Deal [@EU2015].

One of the factors affecting the total efficiency (*ergo*, the yield of all targeted system outputs) of these co-cultivation systems is the availability of the most limited nutrient [@Nederlof2021]. Imbalances of nutrients are considered an important issue in aquaponics [@Bittzanszky2016; @Seawright1998]. In closed and semi-open intensive systems where the majority of substance inputs stems from human activity, the approach of choice is usually to formulate a dedicated feed as simple control measure. However, if the aim is to provide optimum conditions for organisms that absorb nutrients in dissolved form, it is necessary not to neglect nutrient sources other than the feed, their contribution to the nutrient budget and also their variability. Otherwise, optimum values might be missed or even critical values could be reached if the total nutrient concentration is too high or too low in individual cases due to extreme values of another nutrient source.

The objective of this study is to assess the nutrient budget of aquaculture systems with regards to the expected contributions and variabilities in nutrients originating from aquafeeds, alkalinity supplements, and source water. Emphasis is given to plant nutrients as their successful management is crucial for the functioning of integrated systems such as aquaponics. Expanding the body of knowledge with regards to this aspect is thus expected to contribute to improvements of these food production systems by further advancing means of nutrient management.

# Essential nutrients for fish and plants

```{=tex}
\label{sec:essential_nutrients}
```

Fishes as well as plants require a set of elements that have to be provided via the diet or nutrient solution and can be divided into macro- and micronutrients, according to their required quantities. However, they differ both in the required elements and their abundance. Table \ref{tab:essentials} provides an overview of the essential nutrients.

Both fishes and plants require carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur as essential building bricks of the cells and for cellular respiration in large quantities. 

Further essential macronutrients for both are phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. 
All organisms require phosphorus as essential building block for their \gls{dna} and \gls{rna} and for the storage of energy in form of \gls{atp}. It is also the major constituent of phospholipids that form cell membranes. In fish, phosphorus is, in combination with calcium, required for the development and maintenance of the skeletal system [@Lall2021]. Plants also require calcium for their growth, as biochemical processes such as cell elongation and division are affected by calcium [@Mengel2001].
Magnesium contributes to many biological processes in all organisms, from protein synthesis, over cell replication to the energy metabolism. In fish, it also plays a key role in signal transmission via the nervous system, among others [@Lall2021]. Magnesium is the central atom of chlorophyll in plants and is thus crucial for the functioning of photosynthesis [@Mengel2001].

Essential micronutrients required by both fish and plants are iron, copper, manganese, and zinc. 
Iron and copper are important constituents of many metalloproteins and metalloenzymes, such as heme proteins, cytochromes, among others [@Marschner2012; @Lall2021]. After iron, zinc is the second most abundant micronutrient in living organisms. Even though it is a constituent of metalloenzymes, it does not take part in redox reactions. Instead, it stabilises the enzyme structure [@Lall2021; @Marschner2013]. Manganese is an important co-factor for the activation of enzymes. It is also part of some metalloenzymes [@Marschner2013]. In vertebrates, it is involved in bone mineralisation [@Lall2021]. 

A trace elements with proven relevance for fish but without physiological function in plants is iodine. Fish require iodine as constituent of the thyroid hormones that play a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and functioning [@Lall2021].

Meanwhile, essential plant nutrients that are not essential for fish comprise boron, nickel, molybdenum, and chlorine [@Marschner2013].
Boron has been suggested to have several roles in metabolism, formation of cell wall structure, and substance transport. However, even though required in the largest amounts of all plant micronutrients, the physiological role of boron has not been fully understood [@Marschner2013]. Nickel is another micromineral that was found to be essential, while its functions are not yet fully explored. As transition metal, it is again a constituent of metalloproteins and -enzymes [@Marschner2013]. Molybdenum is mostly involved in the nitrogen metabolism, either as constituent or co-factor of metalloenzymes [@Marschner2013]. Chlorine is an indispensable element for the maintenance of the ion balance and the stabilisation of the membrane potential. Even though considered a micronutrient due to it's low requirement, it is present in amounts that are comparable with macronutrients [@Marschner2013].

# Nutrient inputs into semi-open and closed aquaculture systems

## Aquafeeds

### Nutrient composition and changes over the years
Aquafeeds are considered the most important nutrient input into aquaculture systems. Studies comparing nutrient inputs from aquafeeds versus source water in aquaponics found that they are the dominant source of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, manganese, copper, zinc, and molybdenum [@Delaide2017]. Another study found that also the majority of calcium, magnesium, and sulfur originated from the feed [@Strauch2018]. However, the most recent general overview study of mineral inclusion rates in aquafeeds dates back more than 40 years [@Tacon1983]. In the meantime, the raw material composition of aquafeeds has changed substantially. For instance, the amount of fish meal has been reduced in favor of mostly plant-based ingredients [@MOWI2023]. It could thus be assumed that the inclusion rates of those nutrients that are not controlled during aquafeed formulation changed as well. Figure \ref{fig:feedcomp} provides an overview of nutrient inclusion rates compiled from literature studies and feed manufacturer datasheets.

```{r include=FALSE, fig.cap="Inclusion rates of some nutrients essential for fish or plants in different types of aquafeeds. The composition of past feeds is based on data from Tacon, 1983. Data about present aquafeeds was compiled from datasheets and scientific publications providing analyses of commercial aquafeeds for Rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*), Common carp (*Cyprinus carpio*), Pike-perch (*Sander lucioperca*), Nile tilapia (*Oreochromis niloticus*), and African catfish (*Clarias gariepinnus*). The dataset includes starter and grower feeds. Experimental feeds were those specifically formulated for studies related to aquaponics. Aquaponic feeds comprise commercially available feeds (n = 3) for aquaponic systems. Data was compiled from supplier datasheets."}

Nitrogen and phosphorus are subject of continuous research in the field of fish nutrition because nitrogen in form of \gls{cp} is an important cost factor in feed production. Phosphorus, meanwhile, is problematic because it is present in poorly digestible form in some mostly plant-based raw materials. It is therefore excreted in comparatively large quantities and can, in dependence on the production system, lead to water eutrophication and algae blooms [@Sugiura2018].
As a consequence, nitrogen inclusion rates have decreased from values ranging around \SI{96}{\gkg} (\SI{60}{\p} \gls{cp}) in the early days of aquafeed production to approximately \SI{72}{\gkg} (\SI{45}{\p} \gls{cp}) for salmonid fish [@MOWI2023]. An average of \SI{63}{\gkg} (\SI{45}{\p} \gls{cp}) is found in feeds for freshwater species such as carp, tilapia, catfish, and percids (n = 74). The decrease in nitrogen can be ascribed to discoveries such as the protein sparing effect, for instance in rainbow trout, carp, and tilapia [@Takeuchi1978; @Beamish1986; @Shiau1993] and improvements in the digestibility of aquafeeds. 
In the case of phosphorus, average inclusion rates decreased by about `r round((1-16.252/11.662)*100)`\si{\p}, from \SI{16}{\gkg} to \SI{12}{\gkg} (n = 68). The reduction was achieved by a two-step approach, combining the reduction of dietary phosphorus with efforts to increase its bioavailability in aquafeeds [@Sugiura2018]. 

Information about inclusion rates of other nutrients in commercial standard feeds was found in scientific studies (n = 5). The calcium content of aquafeeds in the collected data (n = 5) is on average `r round((1-22.676/17.56)*100)`\si{\p} lower in comparison with past values. This might be due to the close nutritional relation of calcium with phosphorus and the resulting necessity to maintain an optimum calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the feeds [@Hossain2014]. The magnesium and iron content of aquafeeds, meanwhile, might not have changed. The average magnesium content is \SI{2.2}{\gkg} (n = 3) in comparison with \SI{2.1}{\gkg} in past feeds. On average, \SI{200}{\mgkg} iron is found in aquafeeds (n = 4), even though highly variable (cv = \SI{113}{\p}, range \SIrange{40}{544}{\mgkg}). Variability in iron was already noticed in the past [@Tacon1983].

Nowadays, aquafeeds may contain more zinc (n = 4), copper (n = 4), and potassium (n = 2). In the case of zinc, average inclusion rates are `r round((1-90/207)*100)`\si{\p} higher in modern feeds. The average copper inclusion rate increased by `r round((1-15/20)*100)`\si{\p}, while `r round((1-9.5/11.2)*100)`\si{\p} more potassium is present in modern commercial aquafeeds. Data is highly variable, with a \gls{cv} of \SI{61}{\p} and \SI{93}{\p} for zinc and copper, respectively, and a \gls{cv} of \SI{20}{\p} for potassium.

The authors highlight the lack of mineral composition data in the field of aquaculture nutrition, making a statistically sound comparison between past and present values impossible.





### From gross to net feed input
When discussing aquafeeds as nutrient input route into integrated systems, it has to be considered that the gross feed input that is provided is not what is available for the secondary organisms that are co-cultivated in an integrated system (see Figure \ref(fig:metabolism). Instead, the retention of a fraction of nutrients by the livestock must be considered [@Robaina2019].

Finfish species cultivated in aquaculture retain about \SI{19}{\p} of the nitrogen [@Fry2018] and \SI{40}{\p} of the phosphorus [@Sugiura2018] that is provided via aquafeeds. Due to the lack of data for other minerals, a conceptual study approximated their retention efficiency from the retention efficiency of ash as sum parameter [@Roy2022].

```{r include=TRUE, fig.cap="Placeholder showing the metabolic pathways related to fish", out.width="100%", eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("latex", "fish_metabolism.png"))
```


The variability found in the results can be traced back to 

- differences between the nutritional requirements of fish species for which the feeds in the dataset were formulated

- carnivorus fish need more protein, thus more N, thus less other nutrients and different feed ingredient composition, thus changes in the nutrient composition.
- there is, obviously, a variety of fish feeds on the market that have different formulations


- Feed formulators need to react to fluctuations of market prices for raw materials and the natural variation in raw material composition. 
- fish feed composition will have to change to reduce the forage fish demand, making aquaculture more sustainable and fit for the future [@Cottrell2020]. 
- it was shown that differences in raw material composition lead to comparable growth but the nutrient composition can dramatically vary

### Variability through changing nutrient inclusion rates - Speciality feeds

The "brute force" approach.

The importance of aquafeeds as nutrient input is reflected by the development of several commercial specialty feeds. For instance, low-pollution feeds have thus been developed that cause reduced nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from pond and cage aquaculture [@Pigott; @Millian-Sorribes2021]. \gls{ras} pose similar problems for the aquaculture industry due to high initial and operation costs for water purification systems. Reducing the need for water treatment through the development of highly bioavailable aquafeeds therefore reduces costs on the long run. 
Commercial aquaponics feeds, meanwhile, are supposed to increase the excretion of target nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium by fish. The formulation of a specific feed was proposed to provide an “off-the-shelf” nutrient delivery system without additional management effort for aquaponics farmers [@Lennard2017; @Eck2019]. Achieving higher nutrient excretion is possible for instance, by using feed additives 
At least three commercial aquaponics feeds are already on the market. However, according to the datasheets, two out of three feeds do not differ from standard feeds in their phosphorus content. Information with regards to potassium and calcium inclusion rates were reported only for one feed. Here, their inclusion rates were `r (1-20/11)*100`\si{\p} higher and `r (1-15/18)*100`\si{\p} lower than in standard feeds, respectively.





### Changing raw materials - Experimental feeds for integrated systems
Instead of changing the inclusion rate of 

An alternative to altering the inclusion rates of specific substances in aquafeeds is to make use of differences in nutrient excretion patterns through changes in the raw material composition of aquafeeds.


```{r include=TRUE, fig.cap="Mass fractions of some nutrients in different feedstuffs. Dashed red line indicates average inclusion of respective nutrient in fish meal. Data from IAFFD.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("output", "plots", "feedstuff_composition.png"))
```




the recent past, several experiments were conducted to closer examine the extent to which substance excretion patterns by fish are affected by alterations in the raw material composition of aquafeeds [@Gebauer2023; @Shaw2022; @Shaw2022a].

The overall nutrient composition of the experimental diets is comparable with commercially available aquafeeds, with no significant differences in average nutrient inclusion levels. Potassium (t-test: p = 0.3), phosphorus (t-test: p = 0.1), calcium (t-test: p = 0.4), and magnesium (t-test: p = 0.7) had average inclusion rates of \SI{9(2.8)}{\gkg}, \SI{14(4.9)}{\gkg}, \SI{15(8.4)}{\gkg}, and \SI{2(0.7)}{\gkg}, respectively.
Also, no differences were found for iron (t-test: p = 0.4), copper (t-test: p = 0.7), and zinc (t-test: p = 0.2). The average inclusion rates were \SI{348(29)}{\mgkg}, \SI{16(2.9)}{\mgkg}, and \SI{93(35.8)}{\mgkg}, respectively.



















## Water as nutrient source


Aquaponics scholars usually focus on aquafeeds as the main source of nutrients, while the importance of water as nutrient source is denoted as negligible [@Schmautz2016]. However, a comparison of substance flows and their variability is lacking.

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics{../output/plots/map.png}
  \caption{Geographical distribution of water analysis reports included in the source water dataset. Green: analysis of municipal tap water; Red: rainwater analysis.}
  \label{fig:map_water}
\end{figure}
```

After the initial system fill-up, water is added to the system either to compensate evaporation, spillage or leaning losses (e.g., the drum filter backwash) or to dilute accumulating substances such as nitrate [@Maucieri2018]. 

The source water for aquaculture systems originates from wells, surface water such as brooks or rivers, or the municipal tap. In integrated systems, the use of rainwater might be a potential amendmend, considering that, for instance, up to \SI{50}{\p} of the water demand of a greenhouse can be covered by rainwater harvesting in some locations around the world [@Boyaci2019; @Dezetter2022].



Aquaponic systems are seen as especially beneficial for water-scarce regions [@Joyce2019] or urban areas [@Junge2017], where restrictive water management by authorities can be expected, tap water is likely the most important water source. Recent surveys corroborate this assumption, as the results show that the proportion of aquaponic practicioners using municipal tap water in the USA and Europe is \SI{47}{\p} and \SI{71.7}{\p}, respectively [@Pattillo2022; @Raulier2023]. 






```{=tex}
\begin{table}
\centering
  \caption{Concentrations of plant nutrients and other substances relevant for plant production in tap water samples from Europe. Thresholds given by the European Water Directive.}
  \label{tab:watercomp}
  \vspace{1em}
  
  \csvautotabular[separator=semicolon]{../latex/table_summary_water_edited.csv}
  
\end{table}
```

When reviewing analysis reports of water utilities (see Table \ref{tab:watercomp}), it can be seen that tap water is rich in the macronutrients calcium, sulfur, and magnesium. In accordance with this finding is that large amounts of calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, being essential plant nutrients, were found to enter the system via exchange water [@Delaide2017]. 
followed by potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, followed by boron, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese. Interestingly, also the variability in their concentrations appears to follow this trend. 

Calcium, sulfur, and manganese were found to be comparably little variable among sampling sites in Europe, indicated by their \gls{cv} of \SIcv{53}, \SIcv{95}, and \SIcv{64}, respectively. Calcium concentrations ranged from \SIrange{3.3}{147.8}{\mgL}, with an average concentration of \SIci{59.9}{\mgL}{53.9}{66.0}. The second most abundant macronutrient was sulfur, ranging between \SIrange{0.4}{61.8}{\mgL}. On average, \SIci{12.5}{\mgL}{10.4}{14.8} sulfur is present in the water. The concentration range of magnesium in tap water was found to be \SIrange{0.1}{4.0}{\mgL}, averaging \SIci{12.0}{\mgL}{10.6}{13.5}. 

Other substances found in concentrations of \si{\mgL} are potassium, with a range of \SIrange{0.1}{23.6}{\mgL} and average of \SIci{2.76}{\mgL}{2.16}{3.36}, and nitrogen, ranging from \SIrange{0.09}{10.3}{\mgL} and averaging \SIci{2.16}{\mgL}{1.68}{2.65}. The most important nitrogenous compound in water is nitrate, making up the largest proportion of the total nitrogen in solution.

As far as other substances relevant for plant nutrition are analysed by water utilities, their concentrations in water are usually low due to their low solubility. Phosphorus in aqueous solution is mostly present in form of orthophosphates. The concentration of phosphorus as important plant nutrient is generally low in tap water. In the reviewed analysis reports, concentrations ranged from \SIrange{0.1}{6006}{\ugL}, averaging \SIci{223}{\ugL}{-67.2}{514}. The average concentrations of boron, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese were found to be similar. An average of \SIci{47}{\ugL}{30.3}{63.8} boron, \SIci{25.3}{\ugL}{3.35}{47.2} iron, \SIci{18.8}{\ugL}{3.97}{33.7} copper, \SIci{11.5}{\ugL}{1.17}{21.8} zinc, and \SIci{4.39}{\ugL}{2.57}{6.21} manganese was found, respectively. Among these microminerals, iron and zinc had the highest variability (iron: \gls{cv} = \SIcv{480}; zinc: \gls{cv} = \SIcv{448}), ranging from \SIrange{0.005}{1320}{\ugL} and \SIrange{0.5}{200}{\ugL}, respectively. The variability of manganese and boron was found to be lower (manganese: \gls{cv} = \SIcv{224}; boron: \gls{cv} = \SIcv{193}), with a mass concentration range of \SIrange{0.2}{77.1}{\ugL} and \SIrange{5}{638}{\ugL}, respectively.

## Sources and extent of variability

Water can vary both spatially and temporally in its composition, depending on where it is sourced. Tap water can originate from natural springs, ground-, or surface water, where it was in contact with solids or gases for a prolonged period of time. 

The spatial variation of water is caused, for instance, by the properties of the aquifer. An important process that affects the composition of spring- and groundwater is weathering of rock, ion exchange, and the buildup of biomass [@Stumm1981]. In regions where water originates from surface water such as rivers or lakes, gas exchange and resulting chemical reactions, for instance redox reactions with oxygen, are affecting the composition of the water.

Temporal variation can be caused by weather events such as heavy rain, snow melting, floods, or anthropogenic inputs such as agricultural activity.

However, raw water is usually sourced 
might be treated by water utilities due to legislative reasons. 

In the European Union, the composition of tap water is regulated by the EU Drinking Water Directive [@EU2020]. A set of threshold values (see Table \ref{tab:watercomp}) ensures that the water is safe for lifelong human consumption and fulfills technical requirements.
The chemical parameters stated in Annex I, Part B, of the EU Drinking Water Directive are related to potential hazards and comprise threshold values for nitrate, nitrite, boron, copper, and nickel. In addition, technical indicator parameters are defined in Annex I, Part C. Those values affect the pH, conductivity, ammonium, iron, manganese, sulfur (sulphate), sodium, and chloride levels of the water. Comparing these While maximum (pH: also minimum) levels are thus given


A glimpse of the extent of variability of terrestrial waters in their chemical composition is provided in Figure 1.1. 











# Alkalinity supplements as nutrient sources
The term alkalinity supplements summarizes several alkaline substances that are used to maintain a stable pH in the water. The pH in aquaculture systems decreases over time due to the activity of nitrifying bacteria in the biofilter. The conversion of ammonium to nitrate follows the overall simplified reaction equation \ref{eq:nitrification} [@Timmons2010].

\begin{align}
  \ce{NH4+} + 2\ce{O2} + \ce{H2O} -> \ce{NO3-} + 2{H3O+}
  \label{eq:nitrification}
\end{align}

Per mole of ammonium (\ce{NH4+}) that is converted to nitrate (\ce{NO3-}), two moles of hydronium ions (\ce{H3O+}) are released. The decrease in pH causes a decrease in the activity of nitrifyers [Ward2011] and has to be counteracted.

Furthermore, it can be derived from equation \ref{eq:nitrification} that $n(\ce{NH4+})) = n(\ce{N})$ and $2n(\ce{N}) = n(\ce{H3O+})$. Thus, the amount of moles that have to be neutralized can be calculated from the feed input as shown in equation \ref{eq:nitrification_feed}

\begin{align}
  n(\ce{H3O+}) = 2\frac{m(\ce{N})}{M(\ce{N})}
  \label{eq:nitrification_feed}
\end{align}

with the molar mass $M(\ce{N}) = \SI{14.007}{\gmol}$. Sodium based substances such as sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda, \ce{NaHCO3}) are commonly used in aquaculture due to their high and rapid solubility at a comparably cheap price. The chemical reaction with bases such as \ce{NaHCO3}, \ce{KOH}  or \ce{Ca(HCO3)2} is eventually a simple neutralization reaction of the pattern


The mass of sodium, potassium or calcium can consequently be calculated by rearranging equation (2.4) and using the correct stoichiometric conversion factor. High sodium concentrations must be avoided in aquaponic systems due to its phytotoxicity [@Maathuis2014]. Sodium is therefore replaced with several other supplements based on potassium or calcium that come with the benefit of providing an additional source of nutrients besides increasing the pH.

Thus, a stable pH has to be maintained to ensure both high nitrification performance and animal welfare. For this purpose, several Na-based substances such as sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda, \ce{NaHCO3}) are commonly used in aquaculture due to their high and rapid solubility at a comparably cheap price. However, high sodium concentrations must be avoided in aquaponic systems due to its phytotoxicity [@Maathuis2014]. Sodium is therefore replaced with several other supplements based on potassium or calcium that come with the benefit of providing an additional source of nutrients besides increasing the pH.

## Contribution of the nutrient sources to the total nutrient mass flows


Inputs of the remaining two nutrients, K and Ca, were found to be heavily depending on the alkalinity supplement used. In absence of the alkalinity supplement, aquafeeds were found to have the greatest impact on K with a contribution of 81.16%, while a higher proportion of Ca (69.62%; 90% CI: 65.51%, 72.86%) would enter the system on average via the water, compared with an average of30.38% of feed contribution. The difference is more pronounced with respect to Na: 82.25% (90% CI: 73.11%, 86.76%) of the total input was calculated to originate from water while only 17.75% were found to enter the system via daily feeding. However, the calculated quantities of alkalinity supplements necessary to maintain a constant pH were found to dominate each input scenario, resulting in a contribution of more than 80% of the total input of K, Ca, or Na in any case.

## Stoichiometry of nutrient inputs



## Economic considerations





The contribution of different nutrient sources to the total daily nutrient inputs into an aquaponic system were compared based on assumptions derived from literature.
It could overall be confirmed by the current input scenario that aquafeeds serve as major nutrient input route for N, P, K, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Mo after consideration of digestibility and nutrient retention by fish. These results confirm prior findings [@Delaide2017]. Considering variability among locations, it could furthermore be confirmed that Ca, Mg, S, B and Na originate from source water. However, the variability found in the case of Ca does not reflect the usual concentration range of approximately two orders of magnitude found in terrestrial waters [@Stumm1981]. A study reviewing the Ca concentration in tap waters from the USA and Canada found a range from \SIrange{1}{135}{\mgL} [@Morr2006]. 

Considering that the obtained results were obtained making use of assumptions, these initial assumptions need to be discussed. The species distribution with strong emphasis on Tilapia (\emph{Oreochromis} spp.) and African catfish (\emph{Clarias gariepinus}) matches with survey results obtained in Europe [@Villarroel2016], even though approximately half of the studies included in the dataset were conducted in the USA. However, surveys conducted in the USA also revealed that the species mostly cultivated in aquaponic systems are Tilapia [@Love2015; @Pattillo2022]. On the other hand, the average stocking density of 7.69 kg m-3 that was used for the nutrient contribution calculations can neither be considered representative for the intensive cultivation of Tilapia nor for African catfish. While densities between \SIrange{10}{50}{\kg\per\cubicm} are reported as acceptable for cultivation in RAS systems [@El-Sayed2019], densities of \SI{120}{\kg\per\cubicm} were reported to be tolerated by the latter species without any adverse effects on fish health [@Nieuwegiessen2009]. Even though salmonids such as Rainbow trout (\emph{Oncorhynchus mykiss}) are seldom reared in aquaponic systems, they can tolerate stocking densities up to \SI{137}{\kg\per\cubicm}. Though, normal stocking densities range between \SIrange{10}{20}{\kg\per\cubicm}. The assumptions are rather on the lower end for salmonids [@Pennell1996]. Common carp (\emph{Cyprinus carpio}) is irrelevant for aquaponic systems due to its low market price. Though, it was found that fish welfare can be guaranteed at a stocking density of around \SI{28}{\kg\per\cubicm}, which is $\approx 4$ times higher than the assumed density [@Ruane2002]. Consequently, it can be expected that the contribution of aquafeeds to the total daily nutrient input under intensive rearing conditions for the mentioned fish species is considerably higher than assumed in this study. Though, the presented nutrient contribution scenario might be representative for the cultivation of Pikeperch due to the comparably low stocking densities ($\approx$\SI{5}{\kg\per\cubicm}) recommended for its cultivation [@Kestemont2015]. The average \gls{fr} of \SI{2}{\p} is in line with recommendations for the husbandry of Tilapia, Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and Common carp [@Lovell2003]. Another aspect with respect to the contribution of feeds is that the feed composition is, in adaptation to the species to be reared, variable. For instance, crude protein inclusion rates in commercial aquafeeds for the mentioned species range from 32% for O. spp. [@Wilson2003; @El-Sayed2019] to \SI{50}{\p} for Pikeperch [@Geay2015]. Further variation in the nutrient composition is introduced by feed manufacturers due to changes in its raw material composition made because of fluctuations in feed ingredient availability and market prices. While changes in the mass concentrations of crucial nutrients such as the \gls{cp} inclusion rate are acceptable only within tight limits, this might not be the case for other nutrients that are disregarded in the formulation process. Overall, data about the inclusion rates of nutrients relevant for plants in commercial aquafeeds can be considered scarce because these compounds are either not essential for aquatic animals or can be taken up from water via the gills in sufficient quantities. These nutrients are thus usually not considered during feed formulation [@Lall2003]. However, a comprehensive review about the range of plant nutrient mass concentrations in commercial aquafeeds has not yet been conducted to the best of the authors knowledge. The mean water exchange rate of 3% can be considered at the lower end of commonly reported water exchange rates for RAS and within the range recommended for aquaponic systems [@Timmons2010].
