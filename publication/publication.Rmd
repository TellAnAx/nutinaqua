# Introduction
Compared to land animal husbandry, aquaculture faces particular challenges that are caused by the water as a habitat for the farmed animals. In water, solid excreta are directly exposed to dissolution processes and microbial degradation, as long as they are not removed by means of mechanical filtration. Meanwhile, water-soluble substances from feces decomposition, branchial or urinary excretion are highly diluted in the system water, which is eventually discharged. This is a problem from an environmental perspective, but also with regard to the efficient utilisation of finite raw materials, as industrial downstream processes such as biogas production cannot be easily implemented in such systems. Several concepts have thus been developed to valorise those nutrients *in situ*, such as the nutritious pond concept [@Joffre2019], fish-rice co-culture, or aquaponics. All these concepts combine aspects of circular economy, which is nowadays even more in the focus of the scientific community and the general public due to growing world population, climate change and resource scarcity being omnipresent in the media and addressed by policy makers worldwide, for instance in form of the EU Green Deal.

- The efficiency of these co-cultivation systems that comprise multiple trophic levels is usually limited by the most limited nutrient. 
- In the nutritious pond concept, emphasis is given to the ratio of carbon and nitrogen. 
- In aquaponics, all nutrients are in an imbalance [@Bittzanszky2016]. 
- Tackling these problems is usually approached by formulating a dedicated feed.
- at the same time, there is only limited information about which source is contributing what share of nutrients to the system. 
- there is also no information about the variability between locations. A high variability might lead to the failure of a "generalised" nutrient supply system if the extrema lead to a final value that is outside of a tolerable range for whatever.

The objective of this study is to assess the nutrient budget of aquaculture systems with regards to the contribution and variability of aquafeeds, alkalinity supplements, and the source water. Emphasis is given to plant nutrients as their successfull management is crucial for the functioning of integrated systems such as aquaponics. Expanding the body of knowledge with regards to this aspect is thus expected to contribute to improvements of these food production systems by further advancing means of nutrient management.

# Essential nutrients for fish and plants

```{=tex}
\label{sec:essential_nutrients}
```

Fishes as well as plants require a set of elements that have to be provided via the diet or nutrient solution and can be divided into macro- and micronutrients, according to their required quantities. However, they differ both in the required elements and their abundance. Table \ref{tab:essentials} provides an overview of the essential nutrients.

Both fishes and plants require carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur as essential building bricks of the cells and for cellular respiration in large quantities. 

Further essential macronutrients for both are phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. 
All organisms require phosphorus as essential building block for their \gls{dna} and \gls{rna} and for the storage of energy in form of \gls{atp}. It is also the major constituent of phospholipids that form cell membranes. In fish, phosphorus is, in combination with calcium, also required for the development and maintenance of the skeletal system [@Lall2021]. Plants also require calcium for their growth. Biochemical processes such as cell elongation and division are affected by calcium levels [@Mengel2001].
Magnesium contributes to many biological processes in all organisms, from protein synthesis, over cell replication to the energy metabolism. In fish, it also plays a key role in signal transmission via the nervous system, among others [@Lall2021]. Magnesium is the central atom of chlorophyll, thus being crucial for the functioning of photosynthesis [@Mengel2001].

Essential micronutrients required by both fish and plants are iron, copper, manganese, and zinc. 
Iron and copper are important constituents of many metalloproteins and metalloenzymes in both fish and plants, such as heme proteins, cytochromes, among others [@Marschner2012; @Lall2021]. After iron, zinc is the second most abundant micronutrient in living organisms. Being part of metalloenzymes, it does not take part in redox reactions. Instead, it stabilises the enzyme structure [@Lall2021; @Marschner2013]. Manganese is an important co-factor for the activation of enzymes. It is also part of some metalloenzymes [@Marschner2013. In vertebrates, it is also involved in bone mineralisation [@Lall2021]. 

A trace elements with proven relevance for fish but without physiological function in plants is iodine. Fish require iodine as constituent of the thyroid hormones that play a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and functioning [@Lall2021].

Meanwhile, essential plant nutrients that are not essential for fish comprise boron, nickel, molybdenum, and chlorine [@Marschner2013].
Boron has been suggested to have several roles in metabolism, formation of cell wall structure, and substance transport. However, even though required in the largest amounts of all plant micronutrients, the physiological role of boron has not been fully understood [@Marschner2013]. Nickel is another micromineral for which essentiality has been shown but whose functions are not yet fully explored. As transition metal, it is also a constituent of metalloproteins and -enzymes [@Marschner2013]. Molybdenum is mostly involved in the nitrogen metabolism, either as constituent or co-factor of metalloenzymes [@Marschner2013].
Chlorine is an indispensable element for the maintenance of the ion balance and the stabilisation of the membrane potential. Even though considered a micronutrient due to it's low requirement, it is present in amounts that are comparable with macronutrients [@Marschner2013].

# Nutrient sources

## Aquafeeds
Aquafeeds are considered the most important nutrient input into aquaculture systems. Studies comparing nutrient inputs from aquafeeds versus source water in aquaponics found that they are the dominant source of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, manganese, copper, zinc, and molybdenum [@Delaide2017]. Another study found that also the majority of calcium, magnesium, and sulphur originated from the feed [@Strauch2018]. However, the most recent work that provides a general overview of mineral inclusion rates in aquafeeds dating back more than 40 years [@Tacon1983]. In the meantime, the raw material composition of aquafeeds has changed substantially. For instance, the amount of fish meal has been reduced in favour of mostly plant-based ingredients [@MOWI2023]. It could thus be assumed that the inclusion rates of those nutrients that are not controlled during aquafeed formulation changed as well. Figure \ref{fig:feedcomp} provides an overview of nutrient inclusion rates compiled from literature studies and feed manufacturer datasheets.

```{r include=FALSE, fig.cap="Inclusion rates of some nutrients essential for fish or plants in different types of aquafeeds. The composition of past feeds is based on data from Tacon, 1983.

The dataset includes starter and grower feeds. Experimental feeds were those specifically formulated for studies related to aquaponics. Aquaponic feeds comprise commercially available feeds (n = 3) for aquaponic systems. Data was compiled from supplier datasheets."}

Nitrogen in form of \gls{cp} is an important cost factor in feed production. Phosphorus is a problem because it is poorly digestible depending on the raw materials used for feed production. It is therefore excreted in comparatively large quantities and, depending on the production system, leads to water eutrophication and algae blooms [@Sugiura2018]. The nitrogen and phosphorus content of aquafeeds is thus subject to ongoing research. As a consequence, nitrogen inclusion rates have decreased from initial values ranging around \SI{96}{\gkg} (\SI{60}{\p} \gls{cp}) in the early days of aquafeed production to approximately \SI{72}{\gkg} (\SI{45}{\p} \gls{cp}) for salmonid fish [@MOWI2023] and an average of \SI{63}{\gkg} (\SI{45}{\p} \gls{cp}), if aquafeeds for other freshwater species such as carp, tilapia, catfish, and percids are considered (n = 74). This is due to discoveries such as the protein sparing effect, for instance in rainbow trout, carp, and tilapia [@Takeuchi1978; @Beamish1986; @Shiau1993] and improvements in the digestibility of aquafeeds. 
Average inclusion rates of phosphorus decreased by about `r round((1-16.252/11.662)*100)`\si{\p}, from \SI{16}{\gkg} to \SI{12}{\gkg} over time (n = 68). The reduction was achieved by a two-step approach, combining a reduction of dietary phosphorus and efforts to increase its bioavailability in aquafeeds [@Sugiura2018]. 

Little information is available on the inclusion rates of other nutrients, making a statistically sound comparison between past and present values impossible. Though, the calcium content of the aquafeeds in the the collected dataset is on average `r round((1-22.676/17.56)*100)`\si{\p} lower in comparison with past values (n = 5). This might be due to the close nutritional relation of calcium with phosphorus and the resulting necessity to maintain an optimum calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the feeds [@Hossain2014].

The magnesium and iron content of aquafeeds, meanwhile, appears not to have changed. The averge magnesium content was \SI{2.2}{\gkg} (n = 3) in comparison with \SI{2.1}{\gkg} in past feeds. The iron content ranges around \SI{200}{\mgkg} (n = 4), even though highly variable (cv = \SI{113}{\p}), ranging from \SIrange{40}{544}{\mgkg}. However, the variability in iron was alreday noticed in the past [@Tacon1983].

Nowadays, aquafeeds may contain more zinc (n = 4), copper (n = 4), and potassium (n = 2) than in the past. In the case of zinc, inclusion rates were found to be `r round((1-90/207)*100)`\si{\p} higher in modern feeds. The average copper inclusion rate increased by `r round((1-15/20)*100)`\si{\p}, while `r round((1-9.5/11.2)*100)`\si{\p} more potassium was found in modern commercial aquafeeds. However, data was highly variable, with a \gls{cv} of \SI{61}{\p} and \SI{93}{\p} for zinc and copper, respectively, and a \gls{cv} of \SI{20}{\p} for potassium.

The authors highlight the lack of mineral composition data in the field of aquaculture nutrition, despite the extensive literature assessing mineral requirements of finfish.



### Speciality feeds
The importance of aquafeeds as nutrient input are reflected by the development of several commercial speciality feeds, for instance, for cage culture, pond aquaculture, \gls{ras} and aquaponics. 

Pond and cage aquaculture is affected by environmental pollution as consequence of feeding. Low-pollution feeds have thus been developed that cause reduced nitrogen and phosphorus emissions [@Pigott; @Millian-Sorribes2021]. \gls{ras} pose similar problems for the aquaculture industry due to the investment and operation costs for water purification systems. Reducing the proportion of indigestible feed components therefore leads to a financial advantage. 

Commercial aquaponics feeds, meanwhile, are meant to be a response to plant nutrient deficiencies in aquaponic systems. Overall, it is thought that the formulation of a specific feed that meets the nutritional requirements of both fish and plants by leading to higher excretion of otherwise deficient plant nutrients is the most suitable approach for the development of an “off-the-shelf” nutrient delivery system that does not require additional management effort by aquaponics farmers [@Lennard2017; @Eck2019].

An in-depth characterisation of these feeds (n = 3) was not done until now to the best of the author's knowledge. However, even though available data is limited, it can be seen that the phosphorus content of these aquafeeds is highly variable (\gls{cv} = \SI{76}{\p}). The average phosphorus content of \SI{22(17)}{\gkg}, meanwhile, is not significantly different from the unspecific diets (t-test: p = 0.4). Information with regards to potassium and calcium inclusion rates were reported only for one feed. Here, potassium and calcium inclusion rates were `r (1-20/11)*100`\si{\p} higher and `r (1-15/18)*100`\si{\p} lower than the average of unspecific diets, respectively.





### Experimental feeds
In the recent past, experiments were conducted to closer examine the manipulability of substance excretion patterns by fish in relation to alterations in the raw material composition of provided aquafeeds.

The overall nutrient composition of the experimental diets is comparable with commercially available aquafeeds, with no significant differences in average nutrient inclusion levels. Potassium (t-test: p = 0.3), phosphorus (t-test: p = 0.1), calcium (t-test: p = 0.4), and magnesium (t-test: p = 0.7) had average inclusion rates of \SI{9(2.8)}{\gkg}, \SI{14(4.9)}{\gkg}, \SI{15(8.4)}{\gkg}, and \SI{2(0.7)}{\gkg}, respectively.
Also, no differences were found for iron (t-test: p = 0.4), copper (t-test: p = 0.7), and zinc (t-test: p = 0.2). The average inclusion rates were \SI{348(29)}{\mgkg}, \SI{16(2.9)}{\mgkg}, and \SI{93(35.8)}{\mgkg}, respectively.





### Sources and extent of variability
The variability found in the data can be traced back to 1) differences between the nutritional requirements of fish species for which the feeds in the dataset were formulated, 2) the variability in the raw material composition among feeds, and 3) variability in the raw materials themselves.

- carnivorus fish need more protein, thus more N, thus less other nutrients and different feed ingredient composition, thus changes in the nutrient composition.
- there is, obviously, a variety of fish feeds on the market that have different formulations
- Feed formulators need to react to fluctuations of market prices for raw materials and the natural variation in raw material composition. 
- fish feed composition will have to change to reduce the forage fish demand, making aquaculture more sustainable and fit for the future [@Cottrell2020]. 
- it was shown that differences in raw material composition lead to comparable growth but the nutrient composition can dramatically vary

```





**Livestock as causative factor for variance**
When discussing aquafeeds as nutrient input route, digestibility and retention of nutrients by the livestock must be considered. 

The indigestible mass fraction of ingested feed, together with uneaten feed, make up the solid wastes. The fraction of feed that is digestible is meanwhile utilised to sustain the animals’ basal metabolism, somatic growth and reproductive activity. Metabolic end products are then excreted via the gills and the urinary system in dissolved form [@Hardy2003; @Evans2005]. Only the dissolved fraction of the nutrients is immediately available for plant uptake via the root system.

The availability of \gls{adc} and nutrient retention data for individual nutrients depends on whether the nutrient is essential and has to be considered for feed formulation. 

```{r include=TRUE, fig.cap="Placeholder showing the metabolic pathways related to fish", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("latex", "fish_metabolism.png"))
```

Nitrogen that is, for the most part, present as \gls{cp} in aquafeeds, is generally well-digestible, with an \gls{adc} usually being above \SI{70}{\p} and on average approximately \SI{90}{\p} [@Guillaume2001; @IAFFD2021]. The excretion of N as end product of the protein and amino acid catabolism takes place in form of ammonia (\ce{NH3}) and, to a small extent, urea. The predominant excretory site are the gills, followed by renal excretion [@Dabrowski2003]. 

A less digestible nutrient is phosphorus, with \gls{adc} ranging from \SI{70}{\p} to only \SI{40}{\p} and a resulting excretion of \SI{30}{\p} to \SI{60}{\p} of the supply [@Lall2003; @Sugiura2018]. Especially plant ingredients in aquafeeds can cause low \gls{adc} if they are rich in phytic acid. Phytic acid is poorly digestible and can furthermore reduce the digestibility of minerals in the feed. This might also explain contradictory information in literature with reported renal excretion rates of \SI{90}{\p} of the total excreta [@Lall2003] in contrast to estimates of \SI{28}{\p} of excretion taking place in dissolved form and \SI{30}{\p} to \SI{64}{\p} excreted as particulate phosphorus [@Dabrowski2003].

Studies about \gls{adc} for the remaining essential plant nutrients are scarce. Variability of \gls{adc} among different feed ingredients was shown in Atlantic salmon (\emph{Salmo salar}) for Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn, with \gls{adc} ranging between \SIrange{30}{50}{\p} [@Sugiura1998]. Excretion of the earth alkaline metals calcium and magnesium primarily occurs in dissolved form via the gills and urine [@Oikari1985; @Lall2003]. Manganese, in contrast, is mostly excreted in solid form with feces, while renal excretion was found to be negligible [@Lall2003]. Copper is predominantly excreted via the bile [@Bury2003]. Excess dietary copper is not taken up but excreted with feces. Copper inclusion rates in aquafeeds are thus reduced to minimise its release into the environment [@Lall2003]. Excretion of Zinc mostly takes place renally and via the gills [@Lall2003]. 









## Water as nutrient source
Aquaponics scholars usually focus on aquafeeds as the main source of nutrients, while the importance of water as nutrient source is denoted as negligible [@Schmautz2016]. However, a comparison of substance flows and their variability is lacking.

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics{../output/plots/map.png}
  \caption{Geographical distribution of water analysis reports included in the source water dataset. Green: analysis of municipal tap water; Red: rainwater analysis.}
  \label{fig:map_water}
\end{figure}
```

After the initial system fill-up, water is added to the system either to compensate evaporation, spillage or leaning losses (e.g., the drum filter backwash) or to dilute accumulating substances such as nitrate [@Maucieri2018]. The source water for an aquaponic system can originate from wells, collected rain, other sources of surface water, or municipal tap. 

However, considering that aquaponic systems are seen as especially beneficial for water-scarce regions [@Joyce2019] or urban areas [@Junge2017], where restrictive water management by authorities can be expected, tap water is likely the most important water source. Recent surveys corroborate this assumption, as the results show that the proportion of aquaponic practicioners using municipal tap water in the USA and Europe is \SI{47}{\p} and \SI{71.7}{\p}, respectively [@Pattillo2022; @Raulier2023]. 


Thus, the following assessment of water composition data focusses on the evaluation of tap water analyses. 




```{=tex}
\begin{table}
\centering
  \caption{Concentrations of plant nutrients and other substances relevant for plant production in tap water samples from Europe. Thresholds given by the European Water Directive.}
  \label{tab:watercomp}
  \vspace{1em}
  
  \csvautotabular[separator=semicolon]{../latex/table_summary_water_edited.csv}
  
\end{table}
```

When reviewing analysis reports of water utilities (see Table \ref{tab:watercomp}), it can be seen that tap water is rich in the macronutrients calcium, sulfur, and magnesium. In accordance with this finding is that large amounts of calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, being essential plant nutrients, were found to enter the system via exchange water [@Delaide2017]. 
followed by potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, followed by boron, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese. Interestingly, also the variability in their concentrations appears to follow this trend. 

Calcium, sulfur, and manganese were found to be comparably little variable among sampling sites in Europe, indicated by their \gls{cv} of \SIcv{53}, \SIcv{95}, and \SIcv{64}, respectively. Calcium concentrations ranged from \SIrange{3.3}{147.8}{\mgL}, with an average concentration of \SIci{59.9}{\mgL}{53.9}{66.0}. The second most abundant macronutrient was sulfur, ranging between \SIrange{0.4}{61.8}{\mgL}. On average, \SIci{12.5}{\mgL}{10.4}{14.8} sulfur is present in the water. The concentration range of magnesium in tap water was found to be \SIrange{0.1}{4.0}{\mgL}, averaging \SIci{12.0}{\mgL}{10.6}{13.5}. 

Other substances found in concentrations of \si{\mgL} are potassium, with a range of \SIrange{0.1}{23.6}{\mgL} and average of \SIci{2.76}{\mgL}{2.16}{3.36}, and nitrogen, ranging from \SIrange{0.09}{10.3}{\mgL} and averaging \SIci{2.16}{\mgL}{1.68}{2.65}. The most important nitrogenous compound in water is nitrate, making up the largest proportion of the total nitrogen in solution.

As far as other substances relevant for plant nutrition are analysed by water utilities, their concentrations in water are usually low due to their low solubility. Phosphorus in aqueous solution is mostly present in form of orthophosphates. The concentration of phosphorus as important plant nutrient is generally low in tap water. In the reviewed analysis reports, concentrations ranged from \SIrange{0.1}{6006}{\ugL}, averaging \SIci{223}{\ugL}{-67.2}{514}. The average concentrations of boron, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese were found to be similar. An average of \SIci{47}{\ugL}{30.3}{63.8} boron, \SIci{25.3}{\ugL}{3.35}{47.2} iron, \SIci{18.8}{\ugL}{3.97}{33.7} copper, \SIci{11.5}{\ugL}{1.17}{21.8} zinc, and \SIci{4.39}{\ugL}{2.57}{6.21} manganese was found, respectively. Among these microminerals, iron and zinc had the highest variability (iron: \gls{cv} = \SIcv{480}; zinc: \gls{cv} = \SIcv{448}), ranging from \SIrange{0.005}{1320}{\ugL} and \SIrange{0.5}{200}{\ugL}, respectively. The variability of manganese and boron was found to be lower (manganese: \gls{cv} = \SIcv{224}; boron: \gls{cv} = \SIcv{193}), with a mass concentration range of \SIrange{0.2}{77.1}{\ugL} and \SIrange{5}{638}{\ugL}, respectively.

## Sources and extent of variability

Water can vary both spatially and temporally in its composition, depending on where it is sourced. Tap water can originate from natural springs, ground-, or surface water, where it was in contact with solids or gases for a prolonged period of time. 

The spatial variation of water is caused, for instance, by the properties of the aquifer. An important process that affects the composition of spring- and groundwater is weathering of rock, ion exchange, and the buildup of biomass [@Stumm1981]. In regions where water originates from surface water such as rivers or lakes, gas exchange and resulting chemical reactions, for instance redox reactions with oxygen, are affecting the composition of the water.

Temporal variation can be caused by weather events such as heavy rain, snow melting, floods, or anthropogenic inputs such as agricultural activity.

However, raw water is usually sourced 
might be treated by water utilities due to legislative reasons. 

In the European Union, the composition of tap water is regulated by the EU Drinking Water Directive [@EU2020]. A set of threshold values (see Table \ref{tab:watercomp}) ensures that the water is safe for lifelong human consumption and fulfills technical requirements.
The chemical parameters stated in Annex I, Part B, of the EU Drinking Water Directive are related to potential hazards and comprise threshold values for nitrate, nitrite, boron, copper, and nickel. In addition, technical indicator parameters are defined in Annex I, Part C. Those values affect the pH, conductivity, ammonium, iron, manganese, sulfur (sulphate), sodium, and chloride levels of the water. Comparing these While maximum (pH: also minimum) levels are thus given


A glimpse of the extent of variability of terrestrial waters in their chemical composition is provided in Figure 1.1. 











# Alkalinity supplements as nutrient sources
The term alkalinity supplements summarizes several alkaline substances that are used to maintain a stable pH in the water [@Timmons2010]. Nitrification decreases the pH over time and, consequently, also the activity of nitrifyers [Ward2011]. Thus, a stable pH has to be maintained to ensure both high nitrification performance and animal welfare. For this purpose, several Na-based substances such as sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda, \ce{NaHCO3}) are commonly used in aquaculture due to their high and rapid solubility at a comparably cheap price. However, high sodium (Na) concentrations must be avoided in aquaponic systems due to its phytotoxicity [@Maathuis2014]. Na is therefore replaced with several other supplements based on K or Ca that come with the benefit of providing an additional source of nutrients besides increasing the pH.

## Nutrient inclusion rates
- high in single nutrient (>90% purity)

## Sources and extent of variability
- variability very low; depends on the product quality

## Contribution of the nutrient sources to the total nutrient mass flows


Inputs of the remaining two nutrients, K and Ca, were found to be heavily depending on the alkalinity supplement used. In absence of the alkalinity supplement, aquafeeds were found to have the greatest impact on K with a contribution of 81.16%, while a higher proportion of Ca (69.62%; 90% CI: 65.51%, 72.86%) would enter the system on average via the water, compared with an average of30.38% of feed contribution. The difference is more pronounced with respect to Na: 82.25% (90% CI: 73.11%, 86.76%) of the total input was calculated to originate from water while only 17.75% were found to enter the system via daily feeding. However, the calculated quantities of alkalinity supplements necessary to maintain a constant pH were found to dominate each input scenario, resulting in a contribution of more than 80% of the total input of K, Ca, or Na in any case.

## Stoichiometry of nutrient inputs



## Economic considerations





The contribution of different nutrient sources to the total daily nutrient inputs into an aquaponic system were compared based on assumptions derived from literature.
It could overall be confirmed by the current input scenario that aquafeeds serve as major nutrient input route for N, P, K, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Mo after consideration of digestibility and nutrient retention by fish. These results confirm prior findings [@Delaide2017]. Considering variability among locations, it could furthermore be confirmed that Ca, Mg, S, B and Na originate from source water. However, the variability found in the case of Ca does not reflect the usual concentration range of approximately two orders of magnitude found in terrestrial waters [@Stumm1981]. A study reviewing the Ca concentration in tap waters from the USA and Canada found a range from \SIrange{1}{135}{\mgL} [@Morr2006]. 

Considering that the obtained results were obtained making use of assumptions, these initial assumptions need to be discussed. The species distribution with strong emphasis on Tilapia (\emph{Oreochromis} spp.) and African catfish (\emph{Clarias gariepinus}) matches with survey results obtained in Europe [@Villarroel2016], even though approximately half of the studies included in the dataset were conducted in the USA. However, surveys conducted in the USA also revealed that the species mostly cultivated in aquaponic systems are Tilapia [@Love2015; @Pattillo2022]. On the other hand, the average stocking density of 7.69 kg m-3 that was used for the nutrient contribution calculations can neither be considered representative for the intensive cultivation of Tilapia nor for African catfish. While densities between \SIrange{10}{50}{\kg\per\cubicm} are reported as acceptable for cultivation in RAS systems [@El-Sayed2019], densities of \SI{120}{\kg\per\cubicm} were reported to be tolerated by the latter species without any adverse effects on fish health [@Nieuwegiessen2009]. Even though salmonids such as Rainbow trout (\emph{Oncorhynchus mykiss}) are seldom reared in aquaponic systems, they can tolerate stocking densities up to \SI{137}{\kg\per\cubicm}. Though, normal stocking densities range between \SIrange{10}{20}{\kg\per\cubicm}. The assumptions are rather on the lower end for salmonids [@Pennell1996]. Common carp (\emph{Cyprinus carpio}) is irrelevant for aquaponic systems due to its low market price. Though, it was found that fish welfare can be guaranteed at a stocking density of around \SI{28}{\kg\per\cubicm}, which is $\approx 4$ times higher than the assumed density [@Ruane2002]. Consequently, it can be expected that the contribution of aquafeeds to the total daily nutrient input under intensive rearing conditions for the mentioned fish species is considerably higher than assumed in this study. Though, the presented nutrient contribution scenario might be representative for the cultivation of Pikeperch due to the comparably low stocking densities ($\approx$\SI{5}{\kg\per\cubicm}) recommended for its cultivation [@Kestemont2015]. The average \gls{fr} of \SI{2}{\p} is in line with recommendations for the husbandry of Tilapia, Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and Common carp [@Lovell2003]. Another aspect with respect to the contribution of feeds is that the feed composition is, in adaptation to the species to be reared, variable. For instance, crude protein inclusion rates in commercial aquafeeds for the mentioned species range from 32% for O. spp. [@Wilson2003; @El-Sayed2019] to \SI{50}{\p} for Pikeperch [@Geay2015]. Further variation in the nutrient composition is introduced by feed manufacturers due to changes in its raw material composition made because of fluctuations in feed ingredient availability and market prices. While changes in the mass concentrations of crucial nutrients such as the \gls{cp} inclusion rate are acceptable only within tight limits, this might not be the case for other nutrients that are disregarded in the formulation process. Overall, data about the inclusion rates of nutrients relevant for plants in commercial aquafeeds can be considered scarce because these compounds are either not essential for aquatic animals or can be taken up from water via the gills in sufficient quantities. These nutrients are thus usually not considered during feed formulation [@Lall2003]. However, a comprehensive review about the range of plant nutrient mass concentrations in commercial aquafeeds has not yet been conducted to the best of the authors knowledge. The mean water exchange rate of 3% can be considered at the lower end of commonly reported water exchange rates for RAS and within the range recommended for aquaponic systems [@Timmons2010].
