abstract: |
  Integrated multitrophic aquaculture is  are seen as  Optimising substance inputs in a holistic way, into aquaculture systems and their variability is necessary for the efficient co-cultivation of "fed" aquaculture species together with nutrient extractors. However, the literature largely focusses on "fed" species. This study closer examines substance input routes and their contribution to the total substance inputs in closed and semi-open freshwater aquaculture systems. The results clearly show that nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and zinc enter via the feed in closed aquaculture systems with low water exchange rates. The route of entry of other nutrients in turn depends on the location of the system and the water source available there. At this stage, it seems reasonable to focus on nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and zinc in the development of a specific feed for IMTA. However, the formulation of a general all-purpose fish feed for integrated freshwater aquacultures seems unrealistic, as the geographical variations in water composition in Europe do not allow for a reproducible nutrient input regardless of location. Instead, individual solutions will continue to be necessary for each plant in the future. The use of potassium-based alkaline additives has proven to be extremely useful here. Despite the higher price, the supply of potassium can be ensured in a targeted manner. The outcomes of this study will contribute to the development of better nutrient management practices in integrated freshwater aquaculture and provide a new insight into substance flows in such systems.

# Introduction
The aquaculture industry is predicted to grow by \SI{14}{\p} by 2030 [@FAO2022]. Even though beneficial for the economy, the downside of such developments is that food production is also a major source of environmental pollution [@Foley2005]. There is thus a need to transition aquaculture towards a more sustainable production practice and reduce its emissions into the environment. Hence, the promise of a cleaner aquaculture industry by integrating aquaculture systems into artificial trophic webs where fish excreta are valorised by downstream processes led to huge research efforts in the recent past [@Goddek2019]. 

Aquaculture systems mainly produce solid and dissolved wastes as result of the metabolic activity of the livestock. There is thus a variety of potential processes with which aquaculture systems could be coupled. For instance, the production of biogas and volatile fatty acids [@Choudhury2022; @Lobanov2023; @Suhr2015), or its usage as fertiliser through direct field application or remineralisation [@Yogev2020; @Delaide2017; @Goddek2018; @Lobanov2023; @Monsees2017] has been tested to valorise solid waste streams. Wastewater, meanwhile, could be recycled into plant grow beds (aquaponics) or used to cultivate filter feeders. \gls{imta}, including aquaponics, are under intensive research for several decades now, with the earliest records of aquaponics research dating back almost half a century [@Naegel1977]. However, the industrial adoption remains low despite much attention by scientists and policymakers [@Hughes2016].

One of the reasons for the lacking adoption of integrated aquaculture is the comparably high complexity of such systems, which induces further challenges, e.g., the management of nutrients. The availability of nutrients in the right quantities and ratios has been identified as a factor that can considerably affect the efficiency of marine \gls{imta} [@Nederlof2021]. In experiments with aquaponic systems, it was found that the wastewater of aquaculture systems is nutritionally imbalanced [@Bittsanszky2016; @Graber2009; @Kloas2015; @Lunda2019; @Robaina2019]. A study found that sludge derived from freshwater \gls{ras} is deficient in some plant nutrients as well [@Lunda2019]. Biorefinery processes such as anaerobic digestion require the presence of a certain amount of trace minerals without which poor process efficiencies are observed. This is because those substances are either incorporated into or are co-factors for enzymes that are essential for methanogenesis or other metabolic functions [@Demirel2011; @Schattauer2011]. Waste streams utilised for biogas production are, however, oftentimes deficient in specific nutrients [@Ortner2014]. Hence, finding simple solutions to optimise the composition of the waste streams is a necessity to ensure high efficiency of those systems.

Feed is the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus entering an aquaculture system [@Sugiura2018]. Studies related to the optimisation of aquaculture waste streams for downstream processes consequently focussed on the feed (see e.g., @Seawright1998; @Shaw2022; @Shaw2022a; @Roy2022; @Gebauer2023). Targeting the feed has several advantages, because feeding a different feed does not cause additional workload compared with the addition of special chemicals. Also, doubling the inclusion rate of a nutrient in the feed would double the total input if other input flows were negligible. The idea of a feed to solve the issue of nutrient imbalances is thus tempting. However, the hypothesis that feed is the main nutrient input of a wider set of nutrients has never been systematically tested. This lack of information makes it difficult to interpret possible outcomes of experiments. 

Even though there are few studies that evaluated the contribution of feed and water to the nutrient budget [@Delaide2017; @Strauch2018], those studies remain snapshots of their specific experimental design in combination with the limitations of the respective location. It is thus unclear whether it is feasible to optimise the feed in order to achieve desired nutrient levels in the system.

This study reviews the mineral composition of fish feed, water, and alkalinity supplements. Western and Central Europe will serve as example case with regards to water as an input route due to the availability and accessibility of water analysis data by local water suppliers. 
Gathered data is eventually put into relation with expected mass flows of the respective inputs to provide an impression of their respective contribution to the total input of a nutrient into closed freshwater systems. The underlying aim of this endeavor is to identify the nutrients that can be safely manipulated by means of feed formulation. Within this context, safe manipulation refers to an expected reproducible effect, regardless of the location. 
Besides aquaculture experts, this study is intended to also benefit experts from other fields who target the valorisation of aquaculture residues or the reduction emissions from aquaculture systems.

# Methodology

## Software
All calculations and analyses were done using R (v.4.3.2).


## Data acquisition

### Aquafeeds
Nutrient inclusion rates in commercial feeds (n = `r results$n_feeds_commercial`) for Common carp (\emph{Cyprinus carpio}), Pike-perch (\emph{Sander lucioperca}), Nile tilapia (\emph{Oreochromis niloticus}), African catfish (\emph{Clarias gariepinus}), and Rainbow trout (\emph{Oncorhynchus mykiss}) were compiled. `r results$n_feeds_commercial_datasheet` observations were collected in form of feed manufacturer datasheets and `r results$n_feeds_commercial_literature` data records were added from literature (studies using commercial feeds). The mentioned species were chosen due to their cumulated share of $\approx \SI{23}{\p}$ of world freshwater fish production [@FAO2022]. In addition, `r results$n_feeds_experimental` records about the composition of experimental feeds were collected from literature. To find the mentioned literature studies, Scopus was used with the search terms AQUACULTURE, FEED, AQUAPONIC*, and IMTA in different combinations. Resulting studies were screened for information regarding the nutrient composition of utilised feeds.


### Water
The source water of freshwater aquaculture systems can originate from wells, the municipal tap, or surface water such as brooks or rivers [@Timmons2010; @Lawson1994]. In addition, rainwater might cover a share of the water demand in some locations (see e.g., @GallegoAlarcon2019). However, well or tap water is usually preferable as it is usually free of undesired pollutants and pathogens [@Lawson1994]. Approximately \SI{35}{\p} of the tap water worldwide originates from groundwater sources [@Doell2012]. The composition of tap water usually only deviates from groundwater if iron or manganese has to be removed from the raw water before being fed into the drinking water system. However, it can be argued that large quantities of iron and manganese are also undesirable in aquaculture facilities, as they precipitate after oxygenation of the water and can cause damage to pumps and other equipment. This study therefore focusses on tap and rain water. 

To compile the dataset, `r results$n_wateranalysis` tap water analysis reports from `r results$n_wateranalysis_countries` countries all over Europe were collected from local authorities and water utilities in the corresponding municipalities. In addition, `r results$n_observations_water_rain` rain water analyses were collected from literature. The spatial distribution of the data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:map_water}. 

Mean average nutrient concentrations in tap water were estimated by \gls{mle} to account for censored data. Data censoring is the common practice of reporting the value of the instrument detection limit instead of the measured value if the analyte concentration found was below the statistically secured sensitivity range of the measurement instrument [@ISO11843]. However, retaining the affected (censored) data in the dataset would lead to an overestimation of plant nutrient concentrations within the water. \gls{mle} estimation was done using the *cenmle()* function from the *NADA* package. Further information about the underlying principles can be found in the dedicated literature [@Helsel2011].

  \caption{Geographical distribution of water analysis reports included in the source water dataset. Green: analysis of municipal tap water; Red: rainwater analysis.}
  \label{fig:map_water}
\end{figure}
```


### Alkalinity supplements
An amount of \SI{250}{\g} sodium bicarbonate (\ce{NaHCO3}) is recommended per \si{\kg} input of feed with \SI{350}{\g} \gls{cp} \si{\per\kg} on \gls{dm} basis [@Timmons2010]. \SI{250}{\g} of \ce{NaHCO3} contains $\frac{\SI{250}{\g}}{\SI{84.01}{\gmol}} = \SI{2.975}{\mol}$ of \ce{NaHCO3}. After conversion of \gls{cp} to nitrogen by division by the Kjeldahl factor ($f_k = 6.25$), it can be calculated that \SI{1}{\kg} of the stated feed, meanwhile, contains \SI{4}{\mol} nitrogen per \si{\kg} of feed. It can thus be generalised that $\frac{\SI{2.975}{\mol}}{\SI{4}{\mol}} \approx \SI{0.75}{\mol}$ of \ce{NaHCO3} are required per \si{\mol} of nitrogen input via feed. The stoichiometric factor with which the molar input of the cation of salts commonly used for pH control has to be multiplied can be derived from the respective sum formula (e.g., 1 for \ce{NaHCO3}, 2 for \ce{Ca(OH)2}).


## Contribution analysis
\label{sec:method_contribution}
The contribution analysis followed the assumption that the water quality at a chosen location is likely to be subject to comparatively small fluctuations, while any feed available on the market could be chosen. Eventually, a range of fish species which differ in the retention of the nutrients supplied could be grown. This would result in $n = n_{\text{water}} \cdot n_{\text{feed}} \cdot n_{\text{retention}}$ combinations of water, aquafeeds, and the nutrient retention. Furthermore, different amounts of makeup water could be used, depending on the technology level of the system. 

```{=tex}

%  \includegraphics{../latex/permutations.png}
%  \caption{Schematic depiction of the generation of combinations for the %contribution analysis.}
%\end{figure}
```

The dataset for the combination analysis was created by combining water and aquafeed composition metadata that was gathered as described above. Both commercial and experimental feed data was used. Only those nutrients that were present in both water and feed datasets were used. 

The feed input was standardised to $m_{f} = \SI{1}{\kg}$ and three make-up water levels ($V_{w} =  \SI{10}{\L\per\kg}$, \SI{100}{\L\per\kg}, and \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} of feed input) were used. This was assumed as representative for a wide range of fish species [@Dalsgaard2013; @Kloas2015; @Mota2015]. To illustrate the makeup water levels, at a stocking density of $d = \SI{50}{\kg\per\cubicm}$ and a feeding rate of $r_{f} = \SI{2}{\p}$, the resulting system volume would equal to $\frac{m_{f}}{r_{f} \cdot d} \cdot \SI{1000}{\L\per\cubicm} = \SI{1000}{\L}$ and the daily water exchange rates would correspond to \SI{1}{\p}, \SI{10}{\p}, and \SI{100}{\p}, respectively. 

The absolute contributions of water ($a_{w}$) and feed ($a_{f}$) were calculated by multiplying the inputs of feed ($m_{f}$) and water ($V_{w}$) with the corresponding inclusion of each nutrient ($x$) in water ($c_{x}$) and in feed ($\gamma_{x}$). The latter was then multiplied with the possible excretion rates ($r_{e}$), which were computed from nutrient retention rates ($r_{r}$) as $r_{e} = 1 - r_{r}$. Three nutrient retention rates were used, with the mean based on literature data [@Sugiura2018; @Roy2022] and a deviation of $\pm\SI{5}{\p}$ to account for intra- and inter-species variability. Eventually, the absolute contribution of water or feed was converted to its percentage contribution to the total as $p_{(w \lor f)} = \frac{a_{(w \lor f)}}{a_{f} + a_{w}} \cdot \SI{100}{\p}$.










# Essential nutrients for fish and plants

```{=tex}
\label{sec:essential_nutrients}
```

All organisms require a set of elements for the functioning of their metabolism, which can be divided into macro- and microminerals (or trace minerals). Table \ref{tab:essentials} provides an overview of the essential elements for fish, plants, and constraints for fish feed formulation and concentrations in tap water.

```{=tex}
% list of nutrients for fish and plants, together with those that have to be reported by law
\input{../latex/table_essential_nutrients.tex}
```

Nitrogen, and sulphur are essential building bricks of the cells and fuel the metabolism. Further essential macronutrients are phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. All organisms require phosphorus as it provides the backbone of \gls{dna} and \gls{rna} and is essential for energy storage in form of \gls{atp}. It is also the major constituent of phospholipids that form cell membranes. In fish, phosphorus is, in combination with calcium, required for the development and maintenance of the skeletal system [@Lall2021]. Plants also require calcium for their growth, as biochemical processes such as cell elongation and division are affected by it [@Mengel2001].
Magnesium contributes to many biological processes in all organisms, from protein synthesis, over cell replication to the energy metabolism. In fish, it also plays a key role in signal transmission via the nervous system, among others [@Lall2021]. Magnesium is the central atom of chlorophyll in plants and is thus crucial for the functioning of photosynthesis [@Mengel2001].

Trace minerals are usually associated with enzymes, where they play a role as co-factors or act as reactive centers within the enzyme. They are required only in small amounts and their excessive uptake leads to toxicity. 
Iron and copper are important constituents of many metalloproteins and metalloenzymes, such as heme proteins, cytochromes, among others [@Marschner2012; @Lall2021]. For methanogens, iron can be considered an essential macromineral as it is required in large quantities [@Glass2012; @Schattauer2011]. 
After iron, zinc is the second most abundant micronutrient in living organisms. Even though it is a constituent of metalloenzymes, it does not take part in redox reactions. Instead, it stabilises the enzyme structure [@Lall2021; @Marschner2012]. In methanogens, it acts as co-factor for several metalloenzymes [@Glass2012; @Schattauer2011]. 
Manganese is also an important co-factor for enzyme activation [@Schattauer2011] and, in plants, in addition part of some metalloenzymes in plants [@Marschner2012]. In vertebrates, it is involved in bone mineralisation [@Lall2021]. 

A trace element with proven relevance for fish but without physiological function in plants or methanogens is iodine. Fish require iodine as constituent of the thyroid hormones that play an essential role in the regulation of cell growth and functioning [@Lall2021]. 
Cobalt is a constituent of vitamin $\text{B}_{12}$, which cannot be synthethised *de novo* by fishes [@Lall2021]. It is also of utmost importance for methanogens. Here, it is part of methyltransferases, which are essential for the conversion of acetate to methane [@Glass2012]. 
Chromium plays a role in the glucose metabolism of methanogens [@Schattauer2011]. In fish, its function is not yet understood, but its essentiallity was demonstrated [@Lall2021].

Nutrients that are not essential for fish comprise boron, nickel, molybdenum, and chlorine. 
In plants, boron has been suggested to have several roles in metabolism, formation of cell wall structure, and substance transport. However, even though required in the largest amounts of all plant micronutrients, the physiological role of boron has not been fully understood [@Marschner2012]. Boron is required as cofactor in the metabolism of methanogens [@Schattauer2011]. 
Nickel is another micromineral that was found to be essential for plants, while its functions are not yet fully explored. As transition metal, it is again a constituent of metalloproteins and -enzymes [@Marschner2012]. Methanogens require nickel as part of enzymes such as hydrogenases [@Glass2012]. 
Molybdenum acts as constituent or co-factor of metalloenzymes in plants and methanogens. In plants, molybdenum is mostly involved in the nitrogen metabolism [@Schattauer2011; Marschner2012]. 
Chlorine, meanwhile, is an indispensable element for the maintenance of the ion balance and the stabilisation of the membrane potential. Even though considered a micronutrient due to it's low requirement, it is present in amounts that are comparable with macronutrients [@Marschner2012].





# Nutrient inputs into intensive freshwater aquaculture systems
Nutrients can enter intensive aquaculture systems via feed input, water exchange, the addition of chemicals, and gas exchange [@Eck2019]. However, gas exchange is a negligible route of entry, as minerals are not present as gases in the atmosphere. Further information with regards to gas exchange can be found elsewhere (e.g., @Boyd2019). In open or outdoor systems, natural inputs such as insects, leaf litter and alike might also enter the system. These natural inputs are not considered in the following as they are strongly dependent on factors such as the location. 


## Aquafeeds
\label{sec:feed}
A variety of aquafeeds has been developed over the years in order to achieve optimum growth of the vast number of species cultivated in aquaculture. The amount of feed depends on the biomass of the animals in the aquaculture facility. Typically, between one and two per cent of the total biomass is added daily in form of feed.


### Composition of commercial diets and changes over time
The raw material composition of aquafeeds has changed substantially over time. For instance, the amount of fish meal has been reduced in favor of mostly plant-based ingredients [@MOWI2023]. It could thus be assumed that the inclusion rates of those nutrients that are not kept at constant levels during feed formulation changed as well. However, the most recent general overview study of mineral inclusion rates in aquafeeds dates back more than 40 years [@Tacon1983]. Figure \ref{fig:feedcomp} provides an overview of nutrient inclusion rates compiled from literature studies and feed manufacturer datasheets.

```{r feedcomp, include=FALSE, fig.cap="Inclusion rates of some nutrients essential for fish or plants in different types of aquafeeds.

Data about present aquafeeds was compiled from datasheets and scientific publications providing analyses of commercial aquafeeds for Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Pike-perch (Sander lucioperca), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and African catfish (Clarias gariepinnus).

Nitrogen and phosphorus are subject of continuous research in the field of fish nutrition because nitrogen in form of \gls{cp} is an important cost factor in feed production. Phosphorus, meanwhile, is problematic because it is present in poorly digestible form in some mostly plant-based raw materials. It is therefore excreted in comparatively large quantities and can, in dependence on the production system, lead to water eutrophication and algae blooms [@Sugiura2018].
As a consequence, nitrogen inclusion rates have decreased from values ranging around \SI{96}{\gkg} (\SI{60}{\p} \gls{cp}) in the early days of aquafeed production to approximately \SI{72}{\gkg} (\SI{45}{\p} \gls{cp}) for salmonid fish [@MOWI2023]. An average of \SI{63.9}{\gkg} (\SI{41.5}{\p} \gls{cp}; \gls{cv} = \SI{18.5}{\p}) is found in feeds for freshwater species such as carp, tilapia, catfish, and percids (n = 74). The range covered was \SIrange{40}{89.6}{\gkg} (\SIrange{250}{560}{\gkg} \gls{cp}). The decrease in nitrogen can be ascribed to discoveries such as the protein sparing effect, for instance in rainbow trout, carp, and tilapia [@Takeuchi1978; @Beamish1986; @Shiau1993] and improvements in the digestibility of aquafeeds. 

In the case of phosphorus, average inclusion rates decreased by about `r round((1-16.252/11.662)*100)`\si{\p}, from \SI{16}{\gkg} to \SI{12}{\gkg} (n = 68). The reduction was achieved by a two-step approach, combining the reduction of dietary phosphorus with efforts to increase its bioavailability in aquafeeds [@Sugiura2018]. Phosphorus addition to feeds is treated restrictively, which is evident from the low variability (\gls{cv} = \SI{21}{\p}).

Information about inclusion rates of other nutrients in commercial standard feeds was found in scientific studies (n = 5). The calcium content of aquafeeds in the collected data (n = 5) is on average `r round((1-22.676/17.56)*100)`\si{\p} lower in comparison with past values. This might be due to the close nutritional relation of calcium with phosphorus and the resulting necessity to maintain an optimum calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the feeds [@Hossain2014]. As a result, the variability of the calcium inclusion is equal to that of phosphorus (\gls{cv} = \SI{21}{\p}).
The magnesium and iron content of aquafeeds, meanwhile, might not have changed. The average magnesium content is \SI{2.2}{\gkg} (n = 3) in comparison with \SI{2.1}{\gkg} in past feeds. On average, \SI{200}{\mgkg} iron is found in aquafeeds (n = 4), even though highly variable (\gls{cv} = \SI{113}{\p}, range \SIrange{40}{544}{\mgkg}). Comparably high variability in iron was already noticed in the past [@Tacon1983].

Nowadays, aquafeeds may contain more copper, zinc, and potassium. The average copper inclusion rate increased by `r round((1-15/20)*100)`\si{\p} (n = 4), with a variability comparable with iron (\gls{cv} = \SI{93}{\p}). In the case of zinc, average inclusion rates are `r round((1-90/207)*100)`\si{\p} higher (n = 4), while `r round((1-9.5/11.2)*100)`\si{\p} more potassium is present in modern commercial aquafeeds (n = 2). The variability is comparable with nitrogen and phosphorus (zinc: \gls{cv} = \SI{61}{\p}; potassium: \gls{cv} = \SI{20}{\p}).

The authors highlight the lack of mineral composition data in the field of aquaculture nutrition, making a statistically sound comparison between past and present values impossible.


### Speciality feeds
The importance of aquafeeds as nutrient input is reflected by the development of several specialty feeds. For instance, low-pollution feeds have been developed to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from pond and cage aquaculture [@Pigott2003; @MilianSorribes2021]. \gls{ras} pose similar problems for the aquaculture industry due to high initial and operation costs for water purification systems. Reducing the need for water treatment through the development of aquafeeds with highly bioavailable nutrients or  therefore reduces costs on the long run. Feeds for \gls{imta}, in contrast, are supposed to increase the excretion of specific nutrients. As of now, at least three commercial feeds dedicated to aquaponics are commercially available. However, according to the datasheets, two out of three feeds do not differ from standard feeds in their phosphorus content. Information with regards to potassium and calcium inclusion rates were reported only for one feed. Here, their inclusion rates were `r (20/11-1)*100`\si{\p} higher and `r (1-15/18)*100`\si{\p} lower than in standard feeds, respectively.



### Experimental feeds
In the recent past, the extent to which substance excretion patterns by fish are affected by alterations in the raw material composition of aquafeeds was assessed [@Gebauer2023; @Shaw2022; @Shaw2022a]. The overall nutrient composition of the experimental diets is comparable with standard aquafeeds that are commercially available, with no significant differences in average nutrient inclusion levels. Potassium (t-test: p = 0.3), phosphorus (t-test: p = 0.1), calcium (t-test: p = 0.4), and magnesium (t-test: p = 0.7) had average inclusion rates of \SI{9(2.8)}{\gkg}, \SI{14(4.9)}{\gkg}, \SI{15(8.4)}{\gkg}, and \SI{2(0.7)}{\gkg}, respectively.
Also, no differences were found for iron (t-test: p = 0.4), copper (t-test: p = 0.7), and zinc (t-test: p = 0.2). The average inclusion rates were \SI{348(29)}{\mgkg}, \SI{16(2.9)}{\mgkg}, and \SI{93(35.8)}{\mgkg}, respectively.


### Sources of variability
An obvious source of variability in the nutrient composition of fish feeds stems from different nutritional requirements of different fish species. 

Further variability in the composition of feed is caused by the natural variability in the composition of feed raw materials. In the past, feed was formulated with a fixed nutrient composition. 

As fish meal and fish oil made up a large proportion of the feed and the range of other raw materials was small compared to today, it can be assumed that the feed composition and growth performance remained relatively constant. Nowadays, however, an increasing proportion of fish meal and oil is being replaced by plant-based raw materials for reasons of cost reduction and sustainability. Although the proportion of macronutrients in the feed formulation is kept constant, fish meal replacement has an impact on the remaining, non-fixed nutrients. Figure \ref{fig:feedstuffs} gives an overview of the variability of several substances in different raw materials relevant for aquafeed production (data adapted from @IAFFD2021). For example, the proportion of potassium and zinc in non-marine raw materials is up to ten times lower and the proportion of phosphorus in some plant-based raw materials is up to a hundred times lower than in fish meal. 

The dynamic and more varied composition of the raw materials also has an effect on the digestibility of the feed. Two feeds with an identical proximate composition but different raw material compositions can differ significantly in terms of nutrient digestibility and therefore the growth performance of the fish [@Glencross2020]. For this reason, feeds are no longer formulated on the basis of proximate composition, but on the basis of digestibility. This is the case for current feed formulation approaches such as the Aller Aqua Power2 and PowerRAS concept [@AllerAqua2017; @AllerAqua2019], the Alltech Coppens Net Energy concept [@AlltechCoppens2019], or the Biomar P 3.0 concept [@Biomar2019]. Focusing the feed formulation more closely on the target species thus reduces the predictability of the emissions of non-constrained substances. Considering that the proportion of marine feed components needs to be further reduced in order to achieve a sustainable growth of the aquaculture industry [@Hua2019], a further increasing proportion of alternative raw materials and, along with this, increased variability in other substances can be expected.

### From gross to net feed input
When discussing feed as nutrient input route into \gls{imta}, it has to be considered that the provided gross feed input does not correspond to the available nutrients for the co-cultivated organisms (see Figure \ref{fig:metabolism}). It must be considered that a fraction of nutrients is retained by the primary species.

```{r include=TRUE, fig.cap="Placeholder showing the metabolic pathways related to fish", out.width="100%", eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("latex", "fish_metabolism.png"))
```

Finfish species cultivated in aquaculture retain about \SI{19}{\p} of the nitrogen [@Fry2018] and \SI{40}{\p} of the phosphorus [@Sugiura2018] that is provided via the feed Due to the lack of data for other minerals, a conceptual study approximated their retention efficiency from the retention efficiency of ash as sum parameter [@Roy2022].















## Water as nutrient source
The amount of water that is added to an aquaculture system on a daily base is proportional to the stocking density, the daily feed input, and how efficiently the water can be treated in the system. Usually between 10 and \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} of feed are exchanged [@Dalsgaard2013].

Data collected in the scope of the present study is shown in Table \ref{tab:watercomp}. The direct comparison between tap and rain water clearly shows that tap water is significantly richer in ions than rain water. The concentrations of ions found in rain water are in line with what was described as common for continental rain [@Wetzel2011].

```{r waters, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Cumulative frequency distribution of chemical compounds in terrestrial waters. X-axis: logarithmic concentration of compounds. 1 ppm = 1 mg/L. Y-axis: Percentage of sampling points (Stumm and Morgan, 1996).", eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("latex", "waters.png"))
```

Groundwater quality is largely dependent on geochemical processes such as weathering of rock, ion exchange reactions and the build-up of biomass [@Stumm1996], which is also causing spatial variation in the water composition. Temporal fluctuations can be caused by weather events such as heavy rainfall, snowmelt, flooding, or anthropogenic activity, such as agriculture. However, depending on the properties of the soil and the percolation rate of the water, these effects can occur with a time lag.

The variability described above is only reflected to a limited extent in the composition of drinking water in the European Union, as this is regulated by the EU Drinking Water Directive [@EU2020]. A series of limit values (see Table \ref{tab:watercomp}) defines maximum values that should not be exceeded. The limit values for nitrate, nitrite, boron, copper and nickel (specified in Annex I, Part B) are related to potential health hazards. In addition, technical indicator parameters (defined in Annex I, Part C) regulate the pH, conductivity, ammonium, iron, manganese, sulfur (as sulphate), sodium and chloride content of the water to ensure the longevity of the drinking water system.

Rain water, in comparison to groundwater, is poor in ions, as these do not pass into the gas phase during the evaporation of water. However, salt particles in the air can act as nuclei for raindrop formation and eventually dissolve in the water. In close proximity to the sea, sea spray is an important source of those particles. However, a significant proportion also originates from anthropogenic air pollution [@Wetzel2011].

## Alkalinity supplements as nutrient sources
The term alkalinity supplements summarises several alkaline substances that are used to maintain a stable pH in the water of closed and semi-open aquaculture systems. Fishes excrete ammonia as a metabolic end product, which then forms ammonium after reaction with water. Ammonium is then converted to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria in the biofilter. The conversion of ammonium to nitrate follows the overall simplified reaction depicted in Equation \ref{eq:nitrification} [@Timmons2010].

\begin{align}
  \ce{NH4+} + 2\ce{O2} + \ce{H2O} -> \ce{NO3-} + 2{H3O+}
  \label{eq:nitrification}
\end{align}

Per mole of converted ammonium, two moles of hydronium ions are released. This results in a steady decrease of the pH towards regions in which the metabolic activity of the nitrifiers is inhibited [@Ward2011]. As countermeasure, a range of alkalinity supplements is used (see Table \ref{tab:alkalinity}). While sodium bicarbonate (\ce{NaHCO3}) is often used in \gls{ras}, liming with calcium carbonate (\ce{CaCO3}) is often done in pond aquaculture [@Boyd2016; @Boyd2017]. Other substances such as hydroxide salts have been evaluated with respect to their utility in aquaculture as well [@Martins2017; @Sa2017].

```{=tex}
\input{../latex/table_alkalinitysuppl.tex}
```

It can be derived from equation \ref{eq:nitrification} that the amount of hydronium ions to be neutralised is proportional to the amount of nitrogen input from the feed. As a rule of thumb, \SI{4.7}{\g} of alkalinity as \ce{CaCO3} needs to be provided per \si{\g} of \gls{tan}. 
Alkalinity supplements play a special role with regard to nutrient input, as they contribute only one nutrient (the cation) to the system in addition to their function as alkalinity suppliers. The proportion of this nutrient is therefore very high per mass unit when compared to the contribution of feed or water to the same nutrient. An important aspect to be considered is, however, that alkalinity supplements cannot be considered as a continuous nutrient input *per se*. Even though there is a necessity to use these substances, the system operator is free to choose one or several of the available substances at a time and an switch between them upon demand. Such inputs have thus to be considered separately from continuous inputs. The variability upon usage can, on the other hand, be considered to be negligible, as the added substances are of comparably high purity [@Boyd2016]. 










# Drawing the big picture
The previous sections assessed the expected quantities of substances in the most important inputs of an aquaculture facility and their variability. However, knowing the nutrient composition of an individual input flow without accounting for its mass flows does not allow for making a statement about its relevance for the overall nutrient input into an aquaculture system. For this reason, the collected water and feed data is put into relation to each other in the following to provide a new perspective to input flows into aquaculture systems (see Figure \ref{fig:combinations}). The selection of nutrients is based on their presence in both collected feed and water data.


## Contribution of water and feed to total nutrient mass flows
Several generalisable conclusions can be drawn from the contribution analysis. An obvious finding of the contribution analysis is that the proportion of nutrients supplied by the water increases with the amount of makeup water per mass unit of feed supplied. It can also be stated that the proportion of phosphorus entering the system via tap water is negligible. This corroborates literature [@Sugiura2018]. Not more than \SI{5}{\p} of the total phosphorus input can be expected to enter the system via tap water under the examined conditions. At makeup (tap) water levels of \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} of feed, on the other hand, which are described as representative for salmonids and sturgeons [@Dalsgaard2013], more than \SI{80}{\p} of the inputs of potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, zinc, and copper can originate from the water and values above \SI{50}{\p} can be expected in \SIrange{40}{80}{\p} of all cases. Under such conditions, the contribution to the nitrogen input can be expected to range between \SIrange{40}{60}{\p}. 

At lower makeup water supplies ($\approx \SI{100}{\L\per\kg}$ of feed), the possible contribution of water to the total input of calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, and copper can exceed \SI{80}{\p}, and the probability that tap water contributes more than \SI{50}{\p} of the input was found to be between \SIrange{40}{60}{\p} (\SI{20}{\p} for sulfur). Contributions to the zinc input between \SIrange{18}{40}{\p} have a probability of about \SI{40}{\p}, while potassium has \SIrange{15}{30}{\p} input share with \SI{40}{\p} probability. In the case of nitrogen, a share of \SIrange{6}{15}{\p} to the total input can be expected for tap water in all cases.

Makeup water levels as low as \SI{10}{\L\per\kg} of feed might be bearable for species such as African catfish. In such cases, tap water can still contribute between \SIrange{29}{50}{\p} of calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, and copper with a probability of \SI{20}{\p}. On the other hand, the contribution might be below \SI{5}{\p} with a probability of \SI{60}{\p} for sulfur, iron, and copper (\SI{40}{\p} for calcium, \SI{20}{\p} for magnesium). The contribution to the nitrogen, potassium, and zinc input is unlikely to exceed \SI{6}{\p}.

As nutrient concentrations are generally lower in rain water, it is obvious that the proportion of nutrients originating from tap water is higher than that of rain water. However, the results show that rainwater can certainly be responsible for comparatively large amounts of phosphorus input in some cases. Although the input share can be expected to be below \SI{1.5}{\p} with a probability of \SI{60}{\p}, it might contribute between \SIrange{10}{60}{\p} of the total input in \SI{20}{\p} of the scenarios (\SIrange{100}{1000}{\L} makeup water per \si{\kg} of feed). These unexpectedly high values could be a result of air pollution at rainwater sampling sites. A high temporal variability of the phosphorus concentration in rainwater was described in other studies [@Migon1999].

Figure \ref{fig:variability} illustrates the sources of variability in the data raw data. that the coefficients of variance for the respective nutrients are greater in the water than in the feed in almost all cases. Except for iron, copper, and zinc in scenarios were rainwater is the sole water source, the variability found in the data was at least \SI{60}{\p} greater for the water than for the feed. The most pronounced differences between variabilities of feed and water were found for phophorus, potassium, magnesium, and copper in case of tap water and nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in case of rain water. As described in \ref{sec:feed}, the low variance of nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium in the feed is likely due to set constraints during feed formulation.

## The role of alkalinity supplements in nutrient mass flows
Alkalinity supplements play a special role with regard to nutrient input, as they consist of only one cation in addition to the carbonate, bicarbonate or hydroxide anion. In addition, alkalinity supplements can be freely selected by the system operator. There is therefore no permanent influence on the nutrient budget. However, it can be seen from Table \ref{tab:alkalinitycont} that the substance used to compensate for the loss of alkalinity caused by feeding and nitrification has a greater effect on the total nutrient input than the feed and water combined in almost all cases.

# Implications for nutrient management
A conceivable criterion for evaluation of an optimisation approach for integrated aquaculture is, as described before, the predictability of nutrient flows for downstream processes. A perfect approach would ensure constant flows in a ratio that matches the requirements of the downstream process. In addition, site-specific variability could be neglegted. A requirement to achieve this would be that the respective nutrient input clearly dominates the others regarding its contribution to the total input. As the nutrient input via water is site-specific, feed and alkalinity supplements appear as the most promising candidates for optimisation approaches.


## Feeds
This study demonstrates that a general-purpose feed for integrated systems will likely result in reproducible total inputs of phosphorus in a wide range of (closed) freshwater systems. This finding corroborates literature [@Sugiura2018]. The contribution of waterborne or alkalinity supplement-derived phosphorus to the total input can, in turn, be considered negligible. An increased input via feed should thus directly translate into a response in form of an observable increase in dissolved or solid net phosphorus (= after retention). 

In addition, results indicate that whether feed also dominates the inputs of nitrogen, potassium, iron, and zinc is highly dependent on the amount of makeup water used. If makeup water levels do not exceed \SI{100}{\L\per\kg} feed, then feed can be considered an important soure of the stated nutrients. At water exchange rates below \SI{100}{\L\per\kg} feed or with rainwater as sole water source, feed also likely dominates the input of all other nutrients investigated. However, it is questionable whether the water requirements of an aquaculture system can be covered by rainwater. Also, only a few species such as African catfish seem to tolerate such low water makeup water levels [@Dalsgaard2013].

With makeup water levels of \SI{100}{\L\per\kg} feed and higher, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and copper show strong site-specific variability due to differences in the composition of water. It can thus not be expected that the total input of those nutrients will be the same everywhere if a feed was constrained for the stated nutrients. Constraining them during feed formulation can therefore not be recommended if the goals were to achieve reproducibility and a specific nutrient ratio. 

At high makeup water levels beyond \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} feed, results indicate that integrated systems will likely not notably benefit from dedicated formulated feeds in many cases. The probability that a significant proportion of even the majority of nutrients originates from water is considerably high. However, these systems do not run the risk of undesired results caused by variability among batches of commercial feeds, as the contribution of the feeds to the nutrient budget is comparably low.

The validity of the latter statements depends on the targeted percentage increase in nutrients in the system. For instance, a ten-fold increase in the inclusion rate of a nutrient in the feed will likely turn the feed into the main input source of the respective nutrient. On the other hand, such drastic increases might only be possible by using pure substances with exception for manganese, considering that novel protein sources appear to contain rather less than more of the stated nutrients. A promising candidate with this regard might be iron, as its inclusion rates in fish feeds might be increased through the use of raw materials derived from terrestrial animals, such as slaughterhouse wastes. A resulting increase in the iron input could then render the excreta more suitable for anaerobic digestion, considering the importance of iron for methanogens [@Glass2012].

Further considerations with regards to feed formulation approaches for integrated systems would be to rather target a raw material composition with a comparably low number of ingredients. Feeds for integrated systems might also benefit from a conservative choice of raw materials of mostly marine origin. This would also reduce temporal fluctuations in the nutrient composition by ensuring that the variability depends on the natural variability of raw materials alone and not, in addition, on varying inclusion rates through the choice of raw materials. The formulation itself could then be done based on the digestibility of the raw materials to ensure that the growth performance of the fish stock remains at a maximum. When focussing only on the few key nutrients identified in this study, preparing such feed might still not be cost-efficient, as criticised elsewhere [@Colt2021], but the simplicity of handling in comparison with fertiliser or other chemicals might outweigh the cost in some situations.

An additional thought related to the forcefull increase of nutrient supply via feeds is that an increased dietborne supply of certain nutrients could also result in negative effects on the well-being of the fish stock. Increased dietary levels of calcium and magnesium, along with phosphorus, have been reported to cause nephrocalcinosis in a variety of freshwater fishes [@Takvam2023]. While dietborne toxicity of copper and zinc has not been demonstrated in fishes [@Clearwater2002], increased copper excretion might affect the fish stock or the downstream process negatively through toxicity. Intending to manipulate respective nutrients might thus lead to undesirable results, if the feed is not validated in more than one laboratory with considerable distance in between. 

Lastly, fish feeds should be further characterised with regards to their mineral inclusion rate to allow for a better assessment of substance flows for downstream valorisation.



## Alkalinity supplements
The results of the analysis indicate that potassium, calcium and magnesium salts are generally suitable for controlling the entry of the respective substances into the system up to makeup water levels of \SI{100}{\L\per\kg} feed. Potassium salts remain the dominating potassium source also when exchanging \SI{1000}{\L\per\kg} feed. Considering the large effect size of using those salts, it appears to be more reasonable to supply potassium via alkalinity supplements than through the feed. The higher cost of \ce{KHCO3} in comparison with \ce{NaHCO3} (+`r 7.04/1.12*100`\si{\p}) could be reduced by using \ce{KOH} instead (+`r 3.68/1.12*100`\si{\p}) and further reduction could be possible by using mixtures of salts, such as \ce{NaHCO3} together with \ce{KOH} in a ratio of 1:1, for instance. Even when supplying \SI{1000}{\L} makeup water per \si{\kg} feed, this would still result in a `r (85.8/2)/(7.8+6.4)*100`\si{\p} higher supply in potassium on average. 

The disadvantage in using calcium or magnesium salts, on the other hand, could be induced phosphate precipitation, which in turn would reduce the phosphate content in the system [@Stumm1996]. The dynamics with regards to phosphorus thus need to be closely examined.


# Conclusion
In conclusion, it is likely that nutrient management in integrated aquaculture will still have to be adapted to given conditions at the respective site. Currently, dedicated feeds for integrated systems can only be expected to supply phosphorus in a reproducible manner. At low water exchange rates, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, and zinc are likely to enter closed freshwater aquaculture systems via the feed as well. However, results related to other nutrients are highly dependent on the amount of makeup water used per mass unit of feed input. Increasing the iron content might be of particular interest for follow-up sludge valorisation in form of biogas production and could be achieved with terrestrial animal-based raw materials from circular side-streams. The formulation of a general all-purpose fish feed for integrated freshwater aquacultures seems, meanwhile, unrealistic, as the spatial fluctuations in the water composition over Europe do not allow a reproducible nutrient input. Though, for instance in aquaponic systems, the use of potassium-based alkalinity supplements bears potential to counteract lacks in potassium. Despite the higher price, the supply of potassium can be guaranteed in a targeted manner. More research is needed to assess the composition of fish feeds with regards to minerals such as cobalt and other trace elements that are of particular interest for biorefinery processes that showed potential to be applied in aquaculture. The authors hope that the outcomes of this study will help in making aquaculture fit for tomorrow’s circular economy.
