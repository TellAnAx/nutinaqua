The majority of the infused load was excreted renally, no net branchial excretion being detected. Magnesium sulphate infusion led to increased tubular secretion of sulphate. Magnesium chloride infusion led to reduced tubular reabsorption of chloride. Magnesium could either be reabsorbed or secreted in control freshwater-adapted trout, apparently as a function of nutritional status. Fish could switch from reabsorption to secretion in response to magnesium loading. It is suggested that freshwater fish eliminate excess dietary magnesium renally.},

  abstract   = {In recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), mechanical removal of suspended solids by clarifiers or drum filters provides an organic mixture rich in nutrients. Still, in most traditional RAS, this sludge is discharged directly or following dewatering. Here, the potential recycling of nutrients from sludge is assessed, comparing aerobic and anaerobic mobilization of nutrients experimentally, ultimately aiming at an application in aquaponic systems. Nutrient mobilization processes were studied, monitoring soluble nutrients photometrically in the treatment tanks (NO3-N, NO2-N, total ammonia nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP], K+ , Mg2+ and Fe2+ ), the nutrient composition of the sludge (total phosphorus, Fe, Mn, Al, S, Mg, Ca) by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, as well as C:N ratio, total solids (TS) and total suspended solids (TSS). Aerobic treatment (aerated, AT) resulted in a 3.2-fold increase in mean (±SD) SRP from 9.4 (± 0.7) to 29.7 (± 2.1) mg l−1 , most likely owing to a decrease in pH. In contrast, in the anaerobic treatment (unaerated, UT), SRP remained unchanged between 9.4 (± 0.7) and 9.3 (± 0.4) mg l−1 . Both treatments resulted in increased K + concentrations from 28.1 (± 1.5) to 36.8 (± 2.3) mg l −1 in AT and to 32.2 (± 2.3) mg l −1 in UT. AT revealed best mobilization of P and K+ without major losses of NO3-N. Thus, aerobic treatment of water-sludge mixture has a high potential for significant improvements of nutrient recycling in aquaponics.},

Several important advancements have been made in this ﬁeld over the past few decades that have contributed to the continuous increase in aquaculture production while reducing its environmental impact. The goal of sustainable aquaculture production, however, is still far from being achieved with ﬁsh retaining only »40% of P in modern commercial ﬁsh feeds. This review highlights ﬁve major issues concerning P and explores practical approaches toward their resolution. The sustainable development of aquaculture is largely contingent upon the outcomes of problem-solving research rather than efforts to generate knowledge or to simply collecting data.},
